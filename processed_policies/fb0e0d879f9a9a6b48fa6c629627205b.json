The grit and toil of farmers, dedication of agricultural scientists and consistent endeavour of policy makers have together contributed in transforming Indian agriculture from an importer of food grain at the time of independence to a major exporter of foodgrains now. However, the marketing systems and post-harvest marketing infrastructure have not been able to keep pace with the growing production and marketable surplus. This has brought to the fore, the need for providing farmers with access to competitive markets with adequate infrastructure including cold chain logistics, to enable them to realise better prices on the one hand and providing nutritious food to consumers at stable and affordable prices on the other. With this objective in view, the Government of India on 13th November, 2013 approved the proposal of Department of Agriculture & Cooperation for continuation and integration of on-going Central Sector Schemes as Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) during the XII Plan (2012-2017). The ISAM will have the following five sub schemes :- (i) Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) [the existing schemes of Grameen Bhandaran Yojana (GBY) and Development/ Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization (AMIGS) will be merged as AMI] (ii) Marketing Research and Information Network (MRIN) (iii) Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF), (iv) Agri-Business Development (ABD) through Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project Development Facility (PDF) and (v) Choudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (NIAM). 2. Objectives: I. To promote creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure by providing backend subsidy support to State, cooperative and private sector investments. II. To promote creation of scientific storage capacity and to promote pledge financing to increase farmers income. III. To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to the stage of primary processing only) to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary processors. IV. To use ICT as a vehicle of extension to sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new challenges in agricultural marketing. V. To establish a nation-wide information network system for speedy collection and dissemination of market information and data on arrivals and prices for its efficient and timely utilization by farmers and other stake holders. 1 VI. To support framing of grade standards and quality certification of agricultural commodities to help farmers get better and remunerative prices for their graded produce. VII. To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and thereby provide assured market to producers and strengthen backward linkages of agri-business projects with producers and their groups. VIII. To undertake and promote training, research, education, extension and consultancy in the agri marketing sector. 3. The overall budgetary allocation for ISAM is Rs.4548 crores during the XII Plan. Sub scheme-wise break up of budget provision is Rs.4000.00 crores for AMI, Rs.12.00 crores for MRIN, Rs.6.00 crores for SAGF, Rs.500.00 crores for ABD and Rs.30.00 crores for NIAM. 4. The Marketing Division in the Department of Agriculture is the overall incharge of policy formulation for the agricultural marketing sector. The Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) an attached office of the Department will implement the three sub schemes viz. Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Marketing Research and Information Network (MRIN) and Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF); Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), an autonomous organisation will implement the sub scheme ofAgri-Business Development (ABD) through Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project Development Facility (PDF) and Chaudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (NIAM), also an autonomous organisation under the Department will provide training, research and consultancy to stakeholders in the agri marketing sector. 5. While separate guidelines have been formulated for each of the sub scheme to be implemented by the respective organisations mentioned in para 4 above, however, the Marketing Division of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation will have overarching responsibilities for the smooth implementation of the sub schemes. Towards this, Marketing Division may claim up to 0.5% of the scheme funds at its level for incurring administrative expenditure towards more effective MIS, monitoring, impact assessment, hiring consultants, conducting studies, researches and any other facilitative mechanism for more effective implementation. 6. An Empowered Committee constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary (DAC) and comprising of Joint Secretary (Marketing) / Agricultural Marketing Adviser, Director (Marketing), Joint Agricultural Marketing Adviser and Director / Deputy Secretary (Finance), IFD, DAC will resolve difficulties and smaller case to case specific decisions on implementation issues. 7. The guidelines for sub scheme of Agri-Business Development to be implemented by SFAC will come into effect from 24.01.2014. All other sub schemes of ISAM will come into effect from 1st April, 2014. . 2 CHAPTER II AGRICULTURAL MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE (AMI) 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 The country has largely gained self-sufficiency in food production. There is a need to translate this into better remuneration for the producers by increasing focus on agricultural marketing sector. The agricultural marketing sector requires strengthening of supply chain through investments in infrastructure for value addition to agricultural produce, reduction in post- harvest losses, etc. The XII Plan Working Group on Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Secondary Agriculture and Policy Required for Internal and External Trade has estimated an investment requirement of Rs.56,000 crores for marketing infrastructure and value chain development during the Plan period with a budgetary allocation of Rs.20,207 crores. It has also estimated a requirement of 35 million MT storage capacity during XII Plan period. The Planning Commission Working Group on Warehousing Development and Regulation for the XII Plan Period (2012  17) has stated that Warehousing plays a vital role in promoting agricultural marketing, rural banking and financing and ensuring food security in the country. A network of scientifically constructed storage infrastructure will help farmers avoid distress sale of their produce by availing marketing credit through pledge financing and also reduce quantitative and qualitative post-harvest losses. 1.2 For creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure, Grameen Bhandaran Yojana (GBY) is being implemented since 01.04.2001 and Scheme for Development/Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading & Standardisation (AMIGS) is being implemented from 20.10.2004. In the Integrated Scheme for Agriculture Marketing (ISAM), these two viz GBY and AMIGS are being subsumed into one sub scheme, which would henceforth be known as Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI). 1.3 The sub scheme on AMI will be implemented by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), an attached office of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation. A list of Regional / Sub-Offices of DMI is at Annexure I. 1.4 During the XII Plan period, the sub scheme on AMI would be implemented with central assistance of Rs.4000 crores. The sub scheme will target to create 4000 marketing infrastructure projects and storage capacity of 230 lakh tonnes across the country. 3 2. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the sub scheme are: 2.1. To develop agricultural marketing infrastructure for effectively managing marketable surplus of agriculture including horticulture and of allied sectors including dairy, poultry, fishery, livestock and minor forest produce. 2.2 To promote innovative and latest technologies in agricultural marketing infrastructure. 2.3 To promote competitive alternative agricultural marketing infrastructure by encouraging private and cooperative sector investments. 2.4 To promote direct marketing so as to increase market efficiency through reduction in intermediaries and handling channels thus enhancing farmers income. 2.5 To promote creation of scientific storage capacity for storing farm produce, processed farm produce and agricultural inputs etc. to reduce post-harvest and handling losses. 2.6 To provide infrastructure facilities for grading, standardization and quality certification of agricultural produce with the objective of (a) ensuring a price to the farmers commensurate with the quality of the produce and (b) promoting pledge financing and marketing credit, negotiable warehousing receipt system and promotion of forward and future markets to increase farmers income. 2.7 To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to primary processing stage only) to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary processors. Primary processing means adding value to the produce without change in its form and may include washing, sorting, cleaning, grading, waxing, ripening, packaging, labelling etc. 2.8 To create general awareness and provide training to farmers, entrepreneurs market functionaries and other stakeholders on various aspects of agricultural marketing including grading, standardization and quality certification. 3. SALIENT FEATURES: 3.1 LINKAGE TO REFORMS: 3.1.1 State agency projects of those States/Union Territories that have undertaken reforms in their respective APMC Acts to allow/permit (i) Direct Marketing, (ii) Contract Farming and (iii) agricultural produce markets in private and cooperative sectors, will be eligible for assistance under the sub-scheme. 4 State Agency projects are those promoted by State Government Departments like State Agricultural Marketing Departments, State Agricultural Marketing Boards, Agricultural Produce Market Committees, State Warehousing Corporations, State Civil Supplies Corporations etc. However, notwithstanding the reform status, State agencies in all States/ UTs will be eligible to avail assistance for storage infrastructure projects. 3.1.2 Projects promoted by private entrepreneurs other than State agencies will however be eligible to avail assistance under the sub-scheme, irrespective of the reforms undertaken by the State Government/UTs in their respective APMC Acts. 3.2 ELIGIBLE MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE: 3.2.1 As one of the objectives of the sub-scheme is to ensure remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce, activities which are in the nature of either storage or other marketing infrastructure up to primary processing only will be covered. Primary processing for the purpose of this sub scheme relates to value addition to a raw agricultural produce which, after processing, does not result in change of product form. Primary processing for which subsidy under AMI is available are those such as cleaning, cutting, de-podding, de-cortication, bleaching, grading, sorting, packing, labelling, waxing, ripening, chilling, pasteurization, homogenization, freezing, refrigeration and other value addition activities etc. An illustrative list of primary processing activities is given in Annexure II. For other stages of processing, subsidy under relevant schemes of Ministry of Agriculture such as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and of Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) may be availed of. 3.2.2 Marketing Infrastructure permitted under the sub scheme may comprise one or more of the following : 3.2.2.1 Common facilities in the market yards such as platforms for auctioning of the produce, loading, unloading, assembling, drying, cleaning, grading, weighing, mechanical handling equipments, etc. The ancillary / supporting infrastructure like parking sheds, internal roads, garbage disposal arrangements, boundary walls, drinking water etc. are also permissible components. However, subsidy for ancillary / supporting infrastructure in the project will be restricted to 25% of total permissible subsidy of the project as explained in Annexure III. Stand-alone ancillary / supporting infrastructure project will not be assisted. 3.2.2.2 Functional infrastructure for collection/ assembling, drying, cleaning, grading, standardization, SPS (Sanitary & Phytosanitary) measures and quality certification, labelling, packaging, ripening chambers, waxing, value addition facilities (without changing the product form) etc. 5 For functional infrastructure projects (other than storage projects) where plant and machinery is to be installed in civil structure, the cost of plant & machinery should be more than 25% of the Total Financial Outlay (TFO) of the project. If it is less than 25%, subsidy will be restricted accordingly as explained in Annexure IV. In such cases where the infrastructure is of the nature of storage, the cost of the civil structure will be calculated as per the capacity and cost norms of the storage infrastructure. 3.2.2.3 Infrastructure for direct marketing of agricultural commodities from producers to consumers/processing units/ bulk buyers, etc. 3.2.2,4 Infrastructure (equipment, hardware, gadgets, including application software etc.) for E-trading, market intelligence and marketing related extension. 3.2.2.5 Mobile infrastructure for post-harvest operations viz. grading, packaging, quality testing etc. including reefer vans, or any other refrigerated vans will be permissible for assistance. However, transport vehicles such as trucks, van, etc. will not be permissible for assistance. 3.2.2.6 Storage infrastructure like godowns including stand-alone silos for storage of food grains with necessary ancillary facilities like loading, unloading, bagging facility etc., excluding railway siding are eligible for subsidy. Assistance for storage infrastructure will be available on capital cost of the project including cost of allied facilities like boundary wall, internal road, internal drainage system, weighing, grading, packing, quality testing & certification, fire fighting equipment etc. which are functionally required to operate the project. For silos overall ceiling for capacity creation will be kept at 25% of the overall target for storage capacity for the year or actual capacity sanctioned during the year whichever is lower, as illustrated in Annexure-V. The capacity created under silos and subsidy disbursal under the above 25% limit will be implemented and monitored by NABARD, HO and NCDC, HO in respect of projects sanctioned by them. Assistance for renovation will be restricted to storage infrastructure projects of cooperatives only. 3.2.2.7 Stand-alone cold storage projects are not admissible for subsidy since subsidy for stand-alone cold storages is extended by NHB, NHM etc. However, cold storage as a part of a permissible integrated value chain project will be eligible for subsidy provided the cold storage component is not more than 75% of TFO. If it is more than 75%, subsidy will be restricted accordingly as explained in Annexure VI. For these projects, subsidy will be calculated on the basis of capacity calculation and cost norms of NHM, DAC. 3.2.2.8 Integrated Value Chain (IVC) Projects (confined up to stage of primary processing only) 6 Integrated value chain in agricultural marketing denotes a set of inter-linked chain of activities that bring specific agricultural commodity / commodities from harvesting till retailing and for the purpose of this sub scheme may include those activities where value is added to the produce without change in the form of the produce. A value chain can be a vertical linking or a network among various independent business organizations and can involve assembling, cleaning, grading, primary processing, packaging, transportation (only Refrigerated van), weighing, storage, distribution, etc. Modern value chains are characterized by vertical coordination, consolidation of the supply base, agro-industrial processing and use of standards throughout the chain. As focus of AMI subsidy is to transfer direct benefit to the farmers, integrated value chain projects involving activities from post-harvest stage to the stage of primary processing only are to be covered. Subsidy for remaining stages of processing, relevant schemes of Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) etc. may be availed of. 3.2.2.9 The above eligible marketing infrastructure projects are however subject to the restrictions provided in the indicative negative list as at Annexure VII. DAC may modify or amend the negative list from time to time. 3.3 ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES: Assistance under the sub scheme will be available to: 3.3.1 Individuals, Group of farmers / growers, Registered Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs); 3.3.2 Partnership/ Proprietary firms, Companies, Corporations; 3.3.3 Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Self Help Groups (SHGs); 3.3.4 Cooperatives, Cooperative Marketing Federations; 3.3.5 Autonomous Bodies of the Government, Local Bodies (excluding Municipal Corporations for storage infrastructure projects), Panchayats; 3.3.6 State agencies including State Government Departments and autonomous organization / State owned corporations such as Agricultural Produce Market Committees & Marketing Boards, State Warehousing Corporations, State Civil Supplies Corporations etc. 3.4 INSTITUTIONAL LENDING : Subsidy under the sub-scheme is linked to institutional credit and will be available to only such projects financed by: 7 3.4.1 Commercial, Cooperative, Regional Rural Banks, Agricultural Development Finance Companies (ADFCs), State Cooperative Banks (SCBs), State Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs), Scheduled Urban Cooperative Banks, Scheduled Primary Cooperative Banks (PCBs), North Eastern Development Financial Corporation (NEDFi), other institutions eligible for refinance by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) or any other financial institution such as State Financial Corporations (SFCs) approved by DAC. 3.4.2 NABARD co-financed and directly financed marketing infrastructure projects including storage infrastructure projects would be eligible for subsidy where the interest rates are commercial / market related. 3.4.3 State Government / State Government agency storage infrastructure projects financed by NABARD under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) / Warehousing Infrastructure Fund (WIF) / NABARDs own funds. 3.4.4 Projects promoted by cooperatives and financed by National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) or cooperative banks recognized by NCDC in accordance with NCDCs eligibility guidelines. 3.4.5 State agencies have a choice of investing their own funds rather than going for institutional funding. 3.5 CHANNELISING AGENCIES FOR RELEASE OF SUBSIDY: 3.5.1 Subsidy will be released through NABARD for the projects financed by Commercial, Cooperative, Regional Rural Banks, Agricultural Development Finance Companies (ADFCs), State Cooperative Banks (SCBs), State Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs), Scheduled Urban Cooperative Banks, Scheduled Primary Cooperative Banks (PCBs), North Eastern Development Financial Corporation (NEDFi), other institutions eligible for refinance by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) or any other financial institution such as State Financial Corporations (SFCs) approved by DAC. 3.5.2 Subsidy will be released through NCDC for projects financed by NCDC or by cooperative banks recognized by NCDC in accordance with NCDCs eligibility guidelines. 3.5.3 Subsidy will be released directly by DAC in case of projects promoted by State agencies which propose to invest their own funds without availing any loan. 3.5.4 In addition to NABARD and NCDC, DAC may authorize Small Farmers Agri- Business Consortium (SFAC) for release of subsidy for credit linked projects of private sector / State agencies including FPOs. 8 3.6 PROMOTERS CONTRIBUTION & TERM LOAN: 3.6.1 Minimum promoters contribution should be 20% of the project cost. Minimum Term loan (including subsidy) to be sanctioned by the Financial Institution (FI) should be 50% of the project cost. 3.6.2 However, Promoters contribution for storage infrastructure projects of State Government and State Government agencies financed under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)/ Warehouse Infrastructure Fund (WIF) of NABARD may be relaxed as per their respective fund guidelines. 3.6.3 Promoters Contribution in case of own funded State agency projects should be 75% / 66.67% of the project cost as the case may be. 3.7 SUBSIDY PATTERN: The sub scheme envisages back-ended capital subsidy for investment in eligible storage and marketing infrastructure projects as under : 3.7.1 FOR STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS: 3.7.1.1 Capital cost of the project for the purpose of subsidy will be calculated on the project cost as appraised by financial institution or actual cost of eligible components as certified by a Chartered Accountant, whichever is lower subject to the subsidy ceiling per MT as well as overall ceiling given below : Subsidy ceiling Rate of Subsidy Up to 1000 More than Maximum Category (on MT in 1000MT and ceiling capital Rs./MT upto 30000 (Rs. cost) MT in Rs./MT Lakhs) A) North Eastern States, 33.33% 1333.20 1333.20 400.00 Sikkim, UTs of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands, hilly* areas B) In other Areas 1.

For example if a promoter intends to have more than one project of the same or different type including storage project in the same District he/ she will be eligible for a maximum subsidy up to Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be. However, for all such projects of the same promoter in a District, the maximum capacity for storage infrastructure (including other functional infrastructure projects) will be restricted to 30,000 MT capacity. 10 For the purpose of calculation of maximum permissible subsidy (Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be), NABARD, before sanctioning advance subsidy for a project constructed on private leased land, will take in to consideration all projects sanctioned till that date, during XII plan period, on land owned by owner of such leased land. For such cases, RO, NABARD may conduct necessary enquiry to ensure the compliance of this provision regarding maximum permissible limit and if necessary, NABARD may also refer such cases for special attention of Joint Inspection Committee. 3.7.3.2 For non-land based projects: For projects involving standalone mobile infrastructure such as reefer van, combine harvesters (wherever permissible) etc., the maximum amount of subsidy that can be availed of by a promoter in a State/UT during the XII plan period (2012 to 2017) is Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be. It is also made clear that this applies only to those promoters who have not availed full benefit under para 3.7.3.1. For example, if a promoter has already availed the benefit of the scheme during XII plan period in a District, the maximum benefit eligible under this provision will be confined to maximum permissible subsidy minus the subsidy already availed. 3.7.4 To determine the eligibility of projects for maximum permissible subsidy, the date of sanction of loan by FI should be between 01.04.2012 to 31.03.2017. For the purpose of calculation of maximum permissible subsidy, all the projects sanctioned under erstwhile AMIGS and RGY since 1.4.2012 will be accounted for as if sanctioned under this sub scheme. 3.7.5 There will be no maximum ceiling on subsidy in the case of infrastructure projects of State agencies. However, this is not applicable for storage infrastructure projects of State agencies. 3.7.6 There will be no maximum ceiling on subsidy in case of storage infrastructure projects of cooperatives assisted by NCDC. 3.7.7 Co-ownership projects: In case of infrastructure projects including storage infrastructure projects having co-ownership from categories eligible for different rates of subsidy, the subsidy will be available at the lower rate. 3.8 RELEASE OF FUNDS AND SUBSIDY: 3.8.1 FOR PROJECTS PROCESSED BY NABARD: 3.8.1.1 Release of Subsidy by DAC to NABARD: At the commencement of each financial year, based on the Administrative Approval, 50% of the annual budget 11 allocation minus the opening balance at the beginning of the financial year available with NABARD, will be released to NABARD by DAC in advance. The balance allocation will be released upon submission of provisional Utilization Certificate in prescribed format (Annexure VIII) by NABARD indicating 60% utilization of the total fund available in the current financial year and Audited Utilization Certificate and statement of account relating to grant released in the preceding year. 3.8.1.2 Advance subsidy: NABARD will release advance subsidy to the FI for keeping the same in a Subsidy Reserve Fund (SRF) account of the concerned borrowers, to be adjusted finally against loan amount. This amount of 50% eligible subsidy would be released by NABARD to the FI on submission of a project profile- cum-claim form (Annexure IX) complying to sub scheme guidelines. 3.8.1.3 Final subsidy: Remaining 50% of the eligible subsidy amount will be released to the FI by NABARD after an inspection and recommendation by a Joint Inspection Committee (JIC) comprising of officers from NABARD (or its representative), FI and Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI). 3.8.1.4 NABARD, HO will also forward a compiled project-wise list of the sanctioned and completed projects to the Head Office of DMI. 3.8.1.5 The release of subsidy by NABARD to FIs will be subject to availability of funds from DAC. 3.8.2 FOR PROJECTS PROCESSED BY NCDC: 3.8.2.1 At the start of each financial year, based on the Administrative Approval, 50% of the projected annual requirement minus the opening balance at the beginning of the financial year available with NCDC will be released to NCDC by DAC in advance. The balance of the requirement will be released upon submission of Provisional Utilization Certificate in prescribed format by NCDC indicating 60% utilization of the total fund available in the current financial year and Audited Utilization Certificate and statement of account relating to grant released in the preceding year. 3.8.2.2 NCDC will release subsidy in two equal instalments of which first instalment will be released on approval of the project and the second instalment will be released after inspection of the project. NCDC will release the final subsidy and send a project-wise copy of the release letter to DMI, HO. NCDC will furnish provisional utilization certificate in prescribed format (Annexure VIII) to DMI, HO after every release of fund from DAC. 3.8.2.3 NCDC, HO will also forward a compiled project-wise list of the sanctioned and completed projects to the Head Office of DMI. 12 3.8.2.4 The release of subsidy by NCDC will be subject to availability of funds from DAC. 3.8.3. FOR OWN FUNDED STATE AGENCY PROJECTS: In the case of own funded State agency projects, subsidy will be released directly by DAC in two equal instalments of which first instalment will be released on approval of the project by the Sanctioning Committee and the second instalment will be released after inspection of the project. The release of subsidy will be subject to availability of funds with DAC. 3.9 ADJUSTMENT OF SUBSIDY IN BORROWERS ACCOUNT 3.9.1 As the adjustment of subsidy is back ended, the full project cost including the subsidy amount, but excluding the margin money contribution from the promoter, will be disbursed as loan by the FI. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the loan amount in such a way that the total subsidy amount is adjusted after the full loan component with interest is liquidated but not before five years from the date of disbursement of first installment of loan. 3.9.2 The subsidy admissible to the promoter under the sub scheme will be kept in the Subsidy Reserve Fund Account (Borrower-wise) in the books of the FI. On receipt of subsidy by the FI, the loan amount to that extent would be treated as reduced for calculation of interest. No interest would be charged on subsidy received by the FI from the date of receipt of subsidy. FI has to ensure that the subsidy is kept in SRF account only and not in fixed deposits, savings account etc. 3.10 TIME SCHEDULE FOR SUBMISSION OF APPLICATION AND COMPLETION OF PROJECT: 3.10.1 FOR DISBURSEMENT OF ADVANCE SUBSIDY:FI will within 90 days of disbursal of the first installment of loan, submit to RO, NABARD, through its controlling / nodal office, a brief project profile-cum-claim form for advance subsidy in the prescribed form given in Annexure  IX along with the documents as per check list at Annexure  X. A copy of the claim form along with all documents should also be submitted to the Regional Office / Sub-Office of DMI. FI will also inform the promoter about submission of the proposal to RO, NABARD & DMI. NABARD will, every quarter, compile a list of all proposals that have not been submitted in time (viz. within 90 days) and forward the same to DMI, RO / SO. RO, NABARD will also place the matter before the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC). SLBC will review all such matters and ensure that such delays do not recur and the proposals are received by NABARD with in time. 3.10.2.

INTRODUCTION : 1.1 Market information is needed by farmers in planning production and marketing of their produce and equally needed by other market participants in arriving at optimal marketing decisions. The availability and dissemination of complete and accurate marketing information is key to achieve both operational and pricing efficiency in the marketing system. Advancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has made the world a smaller place and a larger market at one go. To fully utilize the new emerging marketing opportunities for the benefit of farming community, establishment of an ICT based Agricultural Marketing Information Network in the country has become inevitable. 1.2 Ministry of Agriculture had launched the ICT based Central Sector Scheme of Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET), in March, 2000, to link important agricultural produce markets spread all over the country and the State Agriculture Marketing Boards and Directorates. The project is being executed with the technical support of National Informatics Centre (NIC). A total number of 3,549 computers were provided under the scheme to 3,241 agricultural produce markets (Annexure-I) up to March, 2013. Computers were also provided to State Agricultural Marketing Boards/ Directorates, etc. An application software package AGMARK, has been developed to facilitate organization and transmission of market data from the markets. 1.3 In order to strengthen interface with farmers and other beneficiaries, AGMARKNET portal (http://agmarknet.nic.in) has been developed. More than 2200 markets are regularly reporting price and arrivals related data which is being disseminated through the portal. The AGMARKNET portal also serves as a single window for accessing websites of various other organizations concerned with agricultural marketing. It provides weekly arrivals and price trend analysis for important markets in respect of major agricultural commodities transacted. It is also linked with Online Commodity Exchange of India Limited, providing futures prices in respect of oilseeds, crops, etc. International price trends of various agricultural commodities available on FAO website are also accessible through the portal. The portal is constantly being enriched. 1.4 During XI plan period 590 new market nodes were covered and replacements of computers for 574 old nodes were undertaken. Out of the existing 7,190 wholesale markets in the country, 3,241 i.e. 45 % had on-line facility under the scheme till the end of XI Plan. During XII Plan, 3,700 new markets are proposed to be covered under the network using mobile and SMS technology in addition to computers. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1 To establish a nation-wide information network for speedy collection and dissemination of market information and data for its efficient and timely utilization; 62 2.2 To facilitate collection and dissemination of information related to better price realization and market access by the farmers. This would cover: (i) Market related information such as market fee, market charges, costs, method of sale, payment, weighment, handling, market functionaries, development programmes, market laws, dispute settlement mechanism, composition of market committees, income and expenditure, etc. (ii) Price-related information such as minimum, maximum and modal prices of varieties and qualities transacted, total arrivals and dispatches with destination, marketing costs and margins, etc. (iii) Infrastructure related information comprising facilities and services available to the farmers with regard to storage and warehousing, cold storage, direct markets, grading, re-handling and repacking etc. (iv) Market requirement related information covering accepted standards and grades, labeling, sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, pledge finance, marketing credit and new opportunities available in respect of better marketing; 2.3 To sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new challenges in agricultural marketing by using ICT as a vehicle of extension; 2.4 To improve efficiency in agricultural marketing through regular training and extension for reaching region-specific farmers in their own language; and 2.5 To provide assistance for marketing research to generate marketing information for its dissemination to farmers and other marketing functionaries at grass-root level to create an ambience of good marketing practices in the country. 2.6 The information relating to the schemes in respect of agricultural marketing implemented by Government Departments and central agencies viz. Commerce, Food and Public Distribution, Consumer Affairs, Health and CCI, JCI, NCDC, NAFED, NTGF, TRIFED, NCCF, NDDB, NHB, APEDA, MPEDA will also be disseminated in user friendly manner. Once the farm produce is standardized and labelled, backed by quality certification, it can be directly offered for sale on Spot Exchange websites in national and international markets. 3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN : 3.1 The agencies involved in execution of the sub scheme are Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI), National Informatics Centre (NIC), State Governments through State Agriculture Marketing Boards (SAMBs)/ Directorates, other National and State level institutions and individual market committees/ authorities wherever applicable in the country. 3.2 Efforts will be made to involve private sector in collection of data and maintenance of the data base. PPP options will be explored to bring expertise and value addition to this activity. 3.3 Overall Plan for connectivity: Supply of Computers and other peripherals as well as installation will be implemented through the vendors empaneled by IT Division of DAC and/or, other sources such as NIC, APMC, State Departments/Agencies in concerned market nodes. The concerned market nodes will arrange internet connectivity through local internet service provider. 63 3.4 It is proposed to also provide IT instruments such as mobile handsets etc. to the market nodes at principal market/ sub-market yard level through the State Implementing Agencies/other implementing agencies. 3.5 NICs role: NIC will develop required software applications, train market personnel in handling computer hardware and software, update the software package from time to time and develop and commission State level portals wherever requested. NIC will also arrange to harmonize/ integrate software packages used by the State Implementing Agencies and or any other Private Agency on their behalf for reporting data to the AGMARKNET Portal. It will continue to manage AGMARKNET portal and facilitate in updating of market information by the market nodes to the portal. Management of AGMARKNET/State level portals could be outsourced wherever considered necessary by respective competent authorities. In case of development of software applications, other than NIC, it could also be out sourced to private agencies, if and when required. 3.6 To improve the quality of data reporting on the portal, at DMI Headquarters, the AGMARKNET team will be strengthened from time to time by outsourcing professionals to monitor and constantly update the portal, in accordance with GFR provisions and with the prior approval of IFD 3.7 The State Implementing Agencies will provide to DMI the list of remaining markets to be covered for connectivity and replacement of old computers under the sub scheme. The State Implementing Agencies must ensure site readiness for successful installation and operation of the node which shall be verified and certified by concerned DMI Office.In case of those markets, where installing computers may be difficult, IT instruments such as mobile handsets or other instruments to harness mobile and sms/GPRS/2g/3G technology may be provided 3.8 Besides the existing system of reporting market information through use of computers in principal market yards, mobile/IT instruments based data reporting system will be introduced for both principal market yards and sub-market yards so as to facilitate collection of market information at grass root level at faster pace. For this, necessary APPS for such IT instruments like mobile handset etc. will be developed through NIC or through outsourcing. 3.9 Market node will collect and transmit relevant information to the State level and AGMARKNET portal. NIC/IT instrument Vendors would train 2 persons from each node in operating computer/mobile device and handling software package/APPS. The SAMB/Department will nominate a nodal officer to coordinate functioning of the node. The State level Nodal Officer will ensure that market level officials perform their functions regularly to keep the node operational. 3.10 The Data Reporting officials at the nodes and State level Nodal Officer will be incentivised for providing regular market data. 3.11 The instrument/device will be used for data uploading and any other official contact only and will be kept under the safe custody of the marketing personnel assigned the responsibility, who will be accountable for breakage/damage or any sort of mal functioning due to mishandling. In normal course, computers and mobile handset devices will be 64 replaced on the recommendation of the Sanctioning Committee, in five years in the case of computers and in three years in the case of mobile handsets. 3.12 A new version of GIS based Atlas will be expedited by NIC for content enrichment and the system will be put in place for regular data updating to make the portal more user friendly. 3.13 Electronic Display Boards / Price Ticker will be provided at every networked market for display of minimum and maximum price of important commodities including their arrivals. These efforts would be dovetailed, as far as possible, with the action being taken by the Forward Markets Commission under the sub scheme of the Department of Economic Affairs, state Agriculture Marketing boards or any other schemes of central/state governments including RKVY etc. 3.14 Strategic alliances will be developed with corporate, telecom players and private users for strengthening marketing intelligence services through sharing of AGMARKNET data and their dissemination to the farmers through SMS / Voice mail/apps through mobile Phones etc. Data collected may be shared with these agencies free of cost. 3.15 Facility will be developed on the portal for farmers to register for getting daily information on prices in nearby markets of their choice. Also sms based query module will be provided where an sms can get the prices on a particular day in a particular market 4.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Grade Standards provide a common language for trade among growers, traders, processors etc. They provide a basis for incentive payment rewarding better quality. Farmers get prices commensurate with the quality produced by them. Grade standards help in electronic trading and issue of Negotiable Warehouse Receipt. The Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937 provides for framing of grade standards and their certification. SAGF sub scheme of the ISAM Scheme is an ongoing plan scheme to support grading and marking of agricultural produce, which involves framing of grade standards and certification of agricultural commodities included in the Schedule of the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937.SAGF sub scheme aims to help DMI implement the Act including meeting the expenditure for the purchase of equipment, chemicals, glassware and apparatus, Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) of the equipment as well as renovation and repair works in the Agmark laboratories/ Regional and Sub-offices of DMI. With this support, 11 Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central Agmark Laboratory, Nagpur are carrying out analysis of research samples and check samples for developing and promoting grading & standardization of agricultural commodities under Agmark. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1 The main objectives of the sub scheme are: 2.1.1 To help farmers get better and remunerative prices by grading of their produce. 2.1.2 To frame grade standards of agricultural commodities as per the provisions in Agricultural Produce ( Grading and Marking ) Act,1937. 2.1.3 To implement AGMARK certification programme for commodities for which grade standards are notified for domestic trade and for exports. 2.1.4 To analyse research samples for creating analytical data base for the framing /revision of grade standards of agricultural commodities. 3. Implementing Agency 3.1 Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) in the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, is the Nodal authority for certification of agricultural commodities including horticulture commodities under AGMARK. 74 4. Infrastructure for the Grading & Standardization Programme : 4.1 DMI has infrastructure of 11 Regional Offices and 26 Sub-offices spread all over the country to implement the certification programme. Head Office at Faridabad attends to the policy matters and framing/revision of standards based on the Reports of research projects carried out at Central Agmark Laboratory(CAL).Eleven Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) spread all over the country provide analytical support for the analysis of research samples and check samples drawn from the authorized packers premises and market. Central Agmark Laboratory at Nagpur is the apex laboratory. The RALs at Mumbai & Chennai and CAL at Nagpur are accredited with National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories (Department of Science & Technology) as per ISO/ IEC 17025. The RALs at Delhi, Jaipur, Kanpur,Kolkatta and Kochi are proposed to be accredited during the 12th Plan. 5. Framing and Revision of Grade Standards. 5.1 Framing of Grade Standards. Standards of agricultural commodities are framed in a scientific way. Basically it involves the following steps. 5.1.1 Agricultural commodity for which grade standards are to be framed is selected based on demand and necessity. 5.1.2 A sampling plan is prepared based on the areas in which the commodity is grown, processed and traded. 5.1.3 Physical and chemical parameters to determine the purity and quality of the commodity are identified. 5.1.4 Samples of the commodity are collected by the field offices from growing areas, whole sale and retail markets as per the sampling plan. 5.1.5 The samples are analysed in the Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central Agmark Laboratory of DMI for the identified parameters. 5.1.6 Analytical data obtained is statistically analysed and Central Agmark Laboratory suggests the limits of various quality parameters for different grades. 5.1.7 The specifications of the commodity prescribed in relevant Regulations of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and international standards viz. Codex Alimentarius Commission, ISO, etc. are consulted. 5.1.8 Draft standards are discussed with trade, industry and consumer organizations. 75 5.1.9 Preliminary Grading & Marking Rules for the Commodity are drafted and are vetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and published in the Gazette of India for inviting comments and suggestions from all stake holders. 5.1.10 The comments/suggestions received are considered and final notification is drafted, vetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and published in the Gazette of India. 5.2 Revision of Grade Standards: Grade Standards notified under the provisions of the Act are frequently revised to keep pace with the development of new varieties of agricultural commodities and technological advancements. 6. Harmonization of Grade Standards: 6.1 The grade standards are being harmonized with international standards such as Codex & ISO and standards framed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The grade standards of Codex, ISO, BIS and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India are consulted while framing the standards and revising them from time to time. Efforts are being made to have a single standard for raw agricultural commodities which is acceptable to all stakeholders viz. farmers, agricultural produce markets, commodity exchanges, retail chains, consumers, etc. 7. Focus on enhancement of income of the farmers: 7.1 The grade standards of 213 agricultural commodities have been notified under the provisions of the Act. These include raw, semi processed and processed commodities. Focus in the 12th plan will be on raw agricultural commodities such as cereals, pulses, oil seeds and fruits and vegetables so that farmers get incentive for grading the produce. Specific focus will be on the grade standards of fruits and vegetables and their grading and marking so that more countries recognize the Agmark certification system as already recognized by the European Union. The work of grading and marking of semi-processed and processed commodities where grading and marking of these commodities does not result into direct enhancement of income of the farmers, will be transferred to concerned Ministry/ Department. 8. Utilization of funds under the Sub Scheme: 8.1 The concerned RAL will procure its required equipment with approval of the competent authority and by following the GFR provisions. 8.2 For other components, provisions of GFR will be followed. All the components will be implemented as per delegated financial powers 9. Certification for Domestic Market: 76 9.1 The sub scheme for certification of agricultural commodities is voluntary as per the provisions of the Act. The persons desirous of certifying an agricultural commodity under AGMARK should have hygienic premises, necessary infrastructure to process and pack the commodity and have access to a well equipped laboratory for the estimation of prescribed parameters. The applicant for Certificate of Authorisation can either set up his own laboratory or have access to an approved State Grading Laboratory or Commercial Laboratory approved by the DMI for grading and marking of the commodities. The Chemist of the laboratory is trained in one of the Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) and is approved for carrying out grading and marking. Certificate of Authorisation ( C.A.) is granted to such parties on their request after they submit the required documents and their capacity to process and pack the commodity and hygienic conditions in the premises are ascertained. The approved Chemist of the C.A. holder analyses the processed commodity for determining the grade standard and gets it packed in his presence. 9.2 Check samples are drawn from premises of the authorised packers and market and these are analysed in RALs to keep check on the certification programme. Action to warn and suspend/cancel the Certificate of Authorisation is taken, if any, check sample is found not conforming to prescribed standards. 9.3 Use of technology will be made to enable C.A. holders and approved laboratories. The present outdated system of issuing replica serial numbers will be replaced by technology enabled system to minimize the human interaction between C.A. holders and officials and to make available these services on 24 by 7 basis. 10. Certification for Exports: DMI is attending to certification of many agricultural commodities for exports. Fruits and vegetables are important. European Commission has approved the conformity checking operations of DMI for pre shipment inspection for export of fresh fruits and vegetables to EU countries. Agricultural Marketing Adviser has been notified as Official Authority and DMI as inspection body for the purpose. Inspection and certification is voluntary. DMI is attending to certification of fruits and vegetables for exports through approved laboratories. 13 laboratories spread all over the country are approved to attend to grading and certification. Grapes, onions, okra and pomegranates are being certified for exports to EU countries. Efforts will be made that certification of agricultural commodities including fruits and vegetables is recognized by other countries also. 11. Revision of Guidelines relating to Agmark Certification Programme. The Guidelines for grant of Certificate of Authorisation for grading and marking of agricultural commodities for domestic market as well for exports and the Guidelines for approval of State Grading Laboratory/Cooperative/Association/Commercial Laboratory for grading and marking 77 for domestic grade and exports will be amended suitably in conformity with modern practices. 12. Physical Targets: 12.1 During the XII Plan period, it is proposed that all the standards will be aligned with BIS and FSSAI. Focus will be on grading primary agricultural produce so as to help farmers in augmentation of incomes. Those activities and semi-processed, processed products will be rationalized which dont result into direct benefits for the farmers, in consultation with BIS etc. It is proposed to analyse 54,000 check samples and 10,300 research samples. 13. Financial Outlay: 13.1 An amount of Rs.6.00 crores has been approved for the implementation of the sub scheme during the XII Plan period, subject to availability of funds as per following details: (Rs. in Crores) Head 201213 201314 201415 201516 201617 Total Machinery & Equipment 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.34 Supplies & Material 0.14 0.15 0.15 0.25 0.25 0.94 Minor Works 0.43 0.45 0.45 0.60 0.60 2.53 Advertising & Publicity 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.21 Wages 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.10 0.10 0.39 Other Administrative 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.35 Expenses Office Expenses 0.16 0.15 0.15 0.28 0.28 1.02 Foreign Travel Expenses 0.02 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.22 Total 0.94 1.00 1.00 1.53 1.53 6.00 78 CHAPTER V AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH VENTURE CAPITAL ASSISTANCE AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILITY 1. Introduction 1.1 Farming is the single largest private sector economic activity in the country. The growth potential in this key sector is immense in view of the changes taking place in food consumption and there is growing demand for high value processed products. Successes in such endeavors will require innovations and partnerships. Private agribusiness provide first point market for the farm sector and growth depends principally on private initiatives. A significant portion of agribusiness activity is the result of small and medium enterprises. Such enterprises are necessarily widespread in location to capture opportunities that arise all along the farm to table supply chain. Key constraints that impede development of new agribusiness projects are access to information and access to credit. Agribusiness entrepreneurs are generally first generation who have business skills but their financial resources are limited for setting up units at the farm gate with backward linkages. In order to facilitate agribusiness development in the country SFAC venture capital sub scheme will: (a) Assist agripreneurs to make investments in setting up agribusiness projects through financial participation, and (b) Provide financial support for preparation of bankable Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) through Project Development Facility (PDF). 2.

(ii) To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and thereby providing assured market to producers for increasing rural income & employment. (iii) To strengthen backward linkages of agri-business projects with producers. (iv) To assist farmers, producer groups, and agriculture graduates to enhance their participation in value chain through Project Development Facility.

The agriculture marketing sector is today witnessing many challenges in the form of trade liberalisation, globalisation, diversification towards high value crops, changing market demands, etc., and therefore needs to become more responsive. Guiding the direction of change in agricultural marketing has become even more challenging. The main endeavour of the subscheme, through capacity building, conducting training, consulting solutions, education and policy advocacy, will be to escalate the agricultural marketing system in the country to a level where it can go hand in hand with the production and market sentiments. 2. OBJECTIVES OF THE SUBSCHEME: 2.1 To undertake and promote the study of applied and operational research in problem areas of agricultural marketing and to act as a national level nodal point for co-ordination of various research studies and dissemination of technologies relevant to agricultural marketing in the country. 2.2 To impart training to various levels of personnel of organizations involved in agricultural marketing activities such as State Agricultural Marketing Boards (SAMB), State Development Departments like Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Forestry, Sericulture, State Agricultural Universities, Co-operative Marketing Societies, Commodity Boards, Input Agencies and Progressive Farmers, Entrepreneurs, etc. To help them develop bankable projects for creation of market infrastructure and integrated value chains 2.3 To conduct research on long-term projects, policy formulations; prepare status paper on leading issues; case studies in specific marketing problems, processing industries, export management, etc. which have a direct bearing on the national economy. 2.4 To offer consultancy services to State and Central Departments, public-sector undertakings, co-operatives, etc. in the formulation of projects and prepare Master Plans for States, Export Institutions, Traders and Farmers. 2.5 To develop promising human resources by providing long-term structured courses in agricultural marketing through Diploma / Degree courses. 2.6 To help State Government to generate self-employment for educated youth by exploiting local potential resources. 2.7 To facilitate Government to formulate policies on emerging issues in agricultural marketing. 104 2.8 To cover a wide information network in the country in agricultural marketing to evolve efficient, innovative and competitive marketing processes. 2.9 To develop as a Centre of Excellence in the field of agricultural marketing by establishing adequate liaison with international organizations. 3. . SALIENT FEATURES: 3.1 Capacity Building/ Training In order to impart quality training to different stakeholders the Institute needs to adopt an innovative approach and widen its horizon in terms of content, knowledge and methodology. In all, during XII Five Year Plan about 675 training programmes will be conducted. The Institute will focus on trainings with wider coverage, client orientation, research based training. 3.1.1 Wider Clientele Coverage: The client base will be increased by targeting national/ state level agencies serving agriculture and allied discipline such as State Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendra,, NGOs, Producers Organizations, Traders Association, elected members of physical markets, Commodity Boards, potential entrepreneurs and farmers, etc. 3.1.2 Target Oriented Course Module To encourage participation from various agencies including private sector target oriented course module will be developed. For this purpose, a training need assessment will be done on regular interval. Training modules imparted by NIAM will be repeatable every two-three years across the country. 3.1.3 Demand driven Training: NIAM will conduct demand driven certificate training courses of 3 to 6 months, in the field of Agri-business, Agri-Marketing etc. to cater to young, unemployed school dropouts to make them employable. NIAM will also consider tie-ups with companies/other organisations so that post-training absorption is 100%. NIAM may tie up with various partners consisting of IIM, SAU and other training institutes both in public and private sector to impart such training. Efforts will be made to make such training programs self financing and self sustainable in near future. 3.1.4 Research Based Trainings: To enhance the quality and practicability of the programme findings of research will be linked with training . Additionally, case studies will be conducted across regions to facilitate documentation of ground realities and for using the same for imparting training. 3.1.5 Developing linkages with the Stakeholder: Linkages will be established between the Institute and different stakeholders from Government as well as 105 corporate sector through workshops, buyers-sellers meet, management development programmes (MDPs), sensitization programme, etc. 3.1.6 International Collaboration in Capacity Building: The Institute would work as a knowledge centre for Asia and pacific region by developing coordination with the FAO and UNDP wherein these agencies will provide academic, technical, institutional and financial support. Similarly, the Institute may collaborate with the other international agencies working in the field of agricultural marketing, agri- business etc. through capacity building, research and faculty exchange programme. 3.2. Research Activities: 3.2.1 Applied research on various aspects of agricultural marketing and dissemination of knowledge is another noble objective of NIAM. NIAM will undertake and promote studies of applied research in problem areas of agricultural marketing and act as a nodal point for coordination of various research studies and dissemination of technologies relevant to agricultural marketing in the country. 3.2.2 NIAM will undertake research studies with focus on: (i) Management oriented case studies and use the findings of these in the training programme and education for strengthening the programmes . For this, NIAM may also collaborate with other institutions. Institutional arrangements will be suitably changed to accommodate such collaborative research. (ii) Research studies which address specific issues. (iii) Detailed study/documentation of each innovation and intervention in agri- marketing sector for the purpose of policy formulation and replication. (iv) Research for development of supply chain, Integrated value Chains for leading fruits and vegetables in collaboration with some national/ international university.

Market planning and designing to create state of art complex requires a professional approach. It not only requires designing and planning of a market at a particular place, but includes a holistic view of the agrarian scenario. In the present era of globalization, market planning and designing encompasses issues such as backward and forward linkage, quality and safety aspects, etc. This requires a broader, futuristic and integrated view of designing and planning, understanding, social parameters, flow variables, architectural concepts, commodity specific infrastructure etc. The consultancy assignments in the above mentioned areas will be taken up by the Institute. As the Government focuses on the increased participation of private players in the development of the sector specially in the creation of infrastructure and in provision of services, NIAM will in addition to consultancies from state government make efforts to get consultancies from corporate sectors. . 3.3.2 The consultancy division of the Institute will be strengthened through  (i) Widening the clientele base with inclusion of private sector (ii) Enhancing human resource as per the requirement of the assignment (iii) Collaboration with other national/ international agencies (iv) Properly defined guidelines for smooth implementation of the projects (v) Allocation of a portion of the revenue generated through consultancy towards faculty development fund as per norms and subject to prior approval of competent authority. (vi) Capacity building of the faculty (vii) Greater autonomy for utilization of revenue generated through consultancy. 3.3.3 NIAM would also arrange for consultancy services for setting up of a Project Development Facility to catalyze investment credit in agri-infrastructure projects 3.4 Education 3.4.1 The education mandate of NIAM aims at developing human resources by providing long-term structured courses in agricultural marketing through diploma courses. The post graduate diploma programme on agri-business management is well designed to meet the shortage of manpower for agri-business management in the country. This highly accredited course will continue to meet the demand for trained manpower in the sector. Presently the course curriculum of NIAM covers most of the issues in agri-business. However, it is pertinent to bring changes in the focus of education in the perspective of new paradigm of agricultural marketing. In 107 order to achieve this, it is proposed to upgrade the existing course. The Institute will focus on following areas- (i) Revision of course content on periodic basis (ii) Identifying best faculty resources in the field of agri-business (iii) Increase the proportion of courses covered by internal faculty gradually over time (iv) Provision for academic development of faculty from time to time / need- based to enhance the quality of teaching in the Institute. 3.4.2 NIAM will try to increase the seats allocated to this course and also run similar programs in all states in collaboration with SAU/Management Institutes and other educational institutes both in Public and Private sector 3.5 Policy Advocacy 3.5.1 NIAM will be pro-active in advising policy interventions and send a monthly advisory on various topics to DAC. Alternatively, DAC may seek advisories from NIAM. 3.5.2 NIAM will create a model project report with respect to each components being funded under the ISAM sub schemes handled by Marketing Division or other Divisions of DAC, related to Agri-Market or Agri Business. These may be created as .pdf document, which may be uploaded on the NIAM website. NIAM will update these every year and these may be freely available to any potential users. 3.5.3 NIAM will undertake issue based studies advised by DAC and make presentations on themes such as E. Trading/Agri Market/Agri business, mobile based service, , Market reforms, storage, etc. and update these on a regular basis. 3.5.4.

The grit and toil of farmers, dedication of agricultural scientists and consistent endeavour of policy makers have together contributed in transforming Indian agriculture from an importer of food grain at the time of independence to a major exporter of foodgrains now. However, the marketing systems and post-harvest marketing infrastructure have not been able to keep pace with the growing production and marketable surplus. This has brought to the fore, the need for providing farmers with access to competitive markets with adequate infrastructure including cold chain logistics, to enable them to realise better prices on the one hand and providing nutritious food to consumers at stable and affordable prices on the other. With this objective in view, the Government of India on 13th November, 2013 approved the proposal of Department of Agriculture & Cooperation for continuation and integration of on-going Central Sector Schemes as Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) during the XII Plan (2012-2017). The ISAM will have the following five sub schemes :- (i) Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) [the existing schemes of Grameen Bhandaran Yojana (GBY) and Development/ Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization (AMIGS) will be merged as AMI] (ii) Marketing Research and Information Network (MRIN) (iii) Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF), (iv) Agri-Business Development (ABD) through Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project Development Facility (PDF) and (v) Choudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (NIAM). 2. Objectives: I. To promote creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure by providing backend subsidy support to State, cooperative and private sector investments. II. To promote creation of scientific storage capacity and to promote pledge financing to increase farmers income. III. To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to the stage of primary processing only) to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary processors. IV. To use ICT as a vehicle of extension to sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new challenges in agricultural marketing. V. To establish a nation-wide information network system for speedy collection and dissemination of market information and data on arrivals and prices for its efficient and timely utilization by farmers and other stake holders. 1 VI. To support framing of grade standards and quality certification of agricultural commodities to help farmers get better and remunerative prices for their graded produce. VII. To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and thereby provide assured market to producers and strengthen backward linkages of agri-business projects with producers and their groups. VIII. To undertake and promote training, research, education, extension and consultancy in the agri marketing sector. 3. The overall budgetary allocation for ISAM is Rs.4548 crores during the XII Plan. Sub scheme-wise break up of budget provision is Rs.4000.00 crores for AMI, Rs.12.00 crores for MRIN, Rs.6.00 crores for SAGF, Rs.500.00 crores for ABD and Rs.30.00 crores for NIAM. 4. The Marketing Division in the Department of Agriculture is the overall incharge of policy formulation for the agricultural marketing sector. The Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) an attached office of the Department will implement the three sub schemes viz. Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Marketing Research and Information Network (MRIN) and Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF); Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), an autonomous organisation will implement the sub scheme ofAgri-Business Development (ABD) through Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project Development Facility (PDF) and Chaudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (NIAM), also an autonomous organisation under the Department will provide training, research and consultancy to stakeholders in the agri marketing sector. 5. While separate guidelines have been formulated for each of the sub scheme to be implemented by the respective organisations mentioned in para 4 above, however, the Marketing Division of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation will have overarching responsibilities for the smooth implementation of the sub schemes. Towards this, Marketing Division may claim up to 0.5% of the scheme funds at its level for incurring administrative expenditure towards more effective MIS, monitoring, impact assessment, hiring consultants, conducting studies, researches and any other facilitative mechanism for more effective implementation. 6. An Empowered Committee constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary (DAC) and comprising of Joint Secretary (Marketing) / Agricultural Marketing Adviser, Director (Marketing), Joint Agricultural Marketing Adviser and Director / Deputy Secretary (Finance), IFD, DAC will resolve difficulties and smaller case to case specific decisions on implementation issues. 7. The guidelines for sub scheme of Agri-Business Development to be implemented by SFAC will come into effect from 24.01.2014. All other sub schemes of ISAM will come into effect from 1st April, 2014. . 2 CHAPTER II AGRICULTURAL MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE (AMI) 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 The country has largely gained self-sufficiency in food production. There is a need to translate this into better remuneration for the producers by increasing focus on agricultural marketing sector. The agricultural marketing sector requires strengthening of supply chain through investments in infrastructure for value addition to agricultural produce, reduction in post- harvest losses, etc. The XII Plan Working Group on Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Secondary Agriculture and Policy Required for Internal and External Trade has estimated an investment requirement of Rs.56,000 crores for marketing infrastructure and value chain development during the Plan period with a budgetary allocation of Rs.20,207 crores. It has also estimated a requirement of 35 million MT storage capacity during XII Plan period. The Planning Commission Working Group on Warehousing Development and Regulation for the XII Plan Period (2012  17) has stated that Warehousing plays a vital role in promoting agricultural marketing, rural banking and financing and ensuring food security in the country. A network of scientifically constructed storage infrastructure will help farmers avoid distress sale of their produce by availing marketing credit through pledge financing and also reduce quantitative and qualitative post-harvest losses. 1.2 For creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure, Grameen Bhandaran Yojana (GBY) is being implemented since 01.04.2001 and Scheme for Development/Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading & Standardisation (AMIGS) is being implemented from 20.10.2004. In the Integrated Scheme for Agriculture Marketing (ISAM), these two viz GBY and AMIGS are being subsumed into one sub scheme, which would henceforth be known as Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI). 1.3 The sub scheme on AMI will be implemented by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), an attached office of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation. A list of Regional / Sub-Offices of DMI is at Annexure I. 1.4 During the XII Plan period, the sub scheme on AMI would be implemented with central assistance of Rs.4000 crores. The sub scheme will target to create 4000 marketing infrastructure projects and storage capacity of 230 lakh tonnes across the country. 3 2. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the sub scheme are: 2.1. To develop agricultural marketing infrastructure for effectively managing marketable surplus of agriculture including horticulture and of allied sectors including dairy, poultry, fishery, livestock and minor forest produce. 2.2 To promote innovative and latest technologies in agricultural marketing infrastructure. 2.3 To promote competitive alternative agricultural marketing infrastructure by encouraging private and cooperative sector investments. 2.4 To promote direct marketing so as to increase market efficiency through reduction in intermediaries and handling channels thus enhancing farmers income. 2.5 To promote creation of scientific storage capacity for storing farm produce, processed farm produce and agricultural inputs etc. to reduce post-harvest and handling losses. 2.6 To provide infrastructure facilities for grading, standardization and quality certification of agricultural produce with the objective of (a) ensuring a price to the farmers commensurate with the quality of the produce and (b) promoting pledge financing and marketing credit, negotiable warehousing receipt system and promotion of forward and future markets to increase farmers income. 2.7 To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to primary processing stage only) to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary processors. Primary processing means adding value to the produce without change in its form and may include washing, sorting, cleaning, grading, waxing, ripening, packaging, labelling etc. 2.8 To create general awareness and provide training to farmers, entrepreneurs market functionaries and other stakeholders on various aspects of agricultural marketing including grading, standardization and quality certification. 3. SALIENT FEATURES: 3.1 LINKAGE TO REFORMS: 3.1.1 State agency projects of those States/Union Territories that have undertaken reforms in their respective APMC Acts to allow/permit (i) Direct Marketing, (ii) Contract Farming and (iii) agricultural produce markets in private and cooperative sectors, will be eligible for assistance under the sub-scheme. 4 State Agency projects are those promoted by State Government Departments like State Agricultural Marketing Departments, State Agricultural Marketing Boards, Agricultural Produce Market Committees, State Warehousing Corporations, State Civil Supplies Corporations etc. However, notwithstanding the reform status, State agencies in all States/ UTs will be eligible to avail assistance for storage infrastructure projects. 3.1.2 Projects promoted by private entrepreneurs other than State agencies will however be eligible to avail assistance under the sub-scheme, irrespective of the reforms undertaken by the State Government/UTs in their respective APMC Acts. 3.2 ELIGIBLE MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE: 3.2.1 As one of the objectives of the sub-scheme is to ensure remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce, activities which are in the nature of either storage or other marketing infrastructure up to primary processing only will be covered. Primary processing for the purpose of this sub scheme relates to value addition to a raw agricultural produce which, after processing, does not result in change of product form. Primary processing for which subsidy under AMI is available are those such as cleaning, cutting, de-podding, de-cortication, bleaching, grading, sorting, packing, labelling, waxing, ripening, chilling, pasteurization, homogenization, freezing, refrigeration and other value addition activities etc. An illustrative list of primary processing activities is given in Annexure II. For other stages of processing, subsidy under relevant schemes of Ministry of Agriculture such as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and of Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) may be availed of. 3.2.2 Marketing Infrastructure permitted under the sub scheme may comprise one or more of the following : 3.2.2.1 Common facilities in the market yards such as platforms for auctioning of the produce, loading, unloading, assembling, drying, cleaning, grading, weighing, mechanical handling equipments, etc. The ancillary / supporting infrastructure like parking sheds, internal roads, garbage disposal arrangements, boundary walls, drinking water etc. are also permissible components. However, subsidy for ancillary / supporting infrastructure in the project will be restricted to 25% of total permissible subsidy of the project as explained in Annexure III. Stand-alone ancillary / supporting infrastructure project will not be assisted. 3.2.2.2 Functional infrastructure for collection/ assembling, drying, cleaning, grading, standardization, SPS (Sanitary & Phytosanitary) measures and quality certification, labelling, packaging, ripening chambers, waxing, value addition facilities (without changing the product form) etc. 5 For functional infrastructure projects (other than storage projects) where plant and machinery is to be installed in civil structure, the cost of plant & machinery should be more than 25% of the Total Financial Outlay (TFO) of the project. If it is less than 25%, subsidy will be restricted accordingly as explained in Annexure IV. In such cases where the infrastructure is of the nature of storage, the cost of the civil structure will be calculated as per the capacity and cost norms of the storage infrastructure. 3.2.2.3 Infrastructure for direct marketing of agricultural commodities from producers to consumers/processing units/ bulk buyers, etc. 3.2.2,4 Infrastructure (equipment, hardware, gadgets, including application software etc.) for E-trading, market intelligence and marketing related extension. 3.2.2.5 Mobile infrastructure for post-harvest operations viz. grading, packaging, quality testing etc. including reefer vans, or any other refrigerated vans will be permissible for assistance.

For silos overall ceiling for capacity creation will be kept at 25% of the overall target for storage capacity for the year or actual capacity sanctioned during the year whichever is lower, as illustrated in Annexure-V. The capacity created under silos and subsidy disbursal under the above 25% limit will be implemented and monitored by NABARD, HO and NCDC, HO in respect of projects sanctioned by them. Assistance for renovation will be restricted to storage infrastructure projects of cooperatives only. 3.2.2.7 Stand-alone cold storage projects are not admissible for subsidy since subsidy for stand-alone cold storages is extended by NHB, NHM etc. However, cold storage as a part of a permissible integrated value chain project will be eligible for subsidy provided the cold storage component is not more than 75% of TFO. If it is more than 75%, subsidy will be restricted accordingly as explained in Annexure VI. For these projects, subsidy will be calculated on the basis of capacity calculation and cost norms of NHM, DAC. 3.2.2.8 Integrated Value Chain (IVC) Projects (confined up to stage of primary processing only) 6 Integrated value chain in agricultural marketing denotes a set of inter-linked chain of activities that bring specific agricultural commodity / commodities from harvesting till retailing and for the purpose of this sub scheme may include those activities where value is added to the produce without change in the form of the produce. A value chain can be a vertical linking or a network among various independent business organizations and can involve assembling, cleaning, grading, primary processing, packaging, transportation (only Refrigerated van), weighing, storage, distribution, etc. Modern value chains are characterized by vertical coordination, consolidation of the supply base, agro-industrial processing and use of standards throughout the chain. As focus of AMI subsidy is to transfer direct benefit to the farmers, integrated value chain projects involving activities from post-harvest stage to the stage of primary processing only are to be covered. Subsidy for remaining stages of processing, relevant schemes of Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) etc. may be availed of. 3.2.2.9 The above eligible marketing infrastructure projects are however subject to the restrictions provided in the indicative negative list as at Annexure VII.

For example if a promoter intends to have more than one project of the same or different type including storage project in the same District he/ she will be eligible for a maximum subsidy up to Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be. However, for all such projects of the same promoter in a District, the maximum capacity for storage infrastructure (including other functional infrastructure projects) will be restricted to 30,000 MT capacity. 10 For the purpose of calculation of maximum permissible subsidy (Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be), NABARD, before sanctioning advance subsidy for a project constructed on private leased land, will take in to consideration all projects sanctioned till that date, during XII plan period, on land owned by owner of such leased land. For such cases, RO, NABARD may conduct necessary enquiry to ensure the compliance of this provision regarding maximum permissible limit and if necessary, NABARD may also refer such cases for special attention of Joint Inspection Committee. 3.7.3.2 For non-land based projects: For projects involving standalone mobile infrastructure such as reefer van, combine harvesters (wherever permissible) etc., the maximum amount of subsidy that can be availed of by a promoter in a State/UT during the XII plan period (2012 to 2017) is Rs.4 crores or Rs.5 crores as the case may be. It is also made clear that this applies only to those promoters who have not availed full benefit under para 3.7.3.1. For example, if a promoter has already availed the benefit of the scheme during XII plan period in a District, the maximum benefit eligible under this provision will be confined to maximum permissible subsidy minus the subsidy already availed. 3.7.4 To determine the eligibility of projects for maximum permissible subsidy, the date of sanction of loan by FI should be between 01.04.2012 to 31.03.2017. For the purpose of calculation of maximum permissible subsidy, all the projects sanctioned under erstwhile AMIGS and RGY since 1.4.2012 will be accounted for as if sanctioned under this sub scheme. 3.7.5 There will be no maximum ceiling on subsidy in the case of infrastructure projects of State agencies. However, this is not applicable for storage infrastructure projects of State agencies. 3.7.6 There will be no maximum ceiling on subsidy in case of storage infrastructure projects of cooperatives assisted by NCDC. 3.7.7 Co-ownership projects: In case of infrastructure projects including storage infrastructure projects having co-ownership from categories eligible for different rates of subsidy, the subsidy will be available at the lower rate. 3.8 RELEASE OF FUNDS AND SUBSIDY: 3.8.1 FOR PROJECTS PROCESSED BY NABARD: 3.8.1.1 Release of Subsidy by DAC to NABARD: At the commencement of each financial year, based on the Administrative Approval, 50% of the annual budget 11 allocation minus the opening balance at the beginning of the financial year available with NABARD, will be released to NABARD by DAC in advance.

INTRODUCTION : 1.1 Market information is needed by farmers in planning production and marketing of their produce and equally needed by other market participants in arriving at optimal marketing decisions. The availability and dissemination of complete and accurate marketing information is key to achieve both operational and pricing efficiency in the marketing system. Advancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has made the world a smaller place and a larger market at one go. To fully utilize the new emerging marketing opportunities for the benefit of farming community, establishment of an ICT based Agricultural Marketing Information Network in the country has become inevitable. 1.2 Ministry of Agriculture had launched the ICT based Central Sector Scheme of Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET), in March, 2000, to link important agricultural produce markets spread all over the country and the State Agriculture Marketing Boards and Directorates. The project is being executed with the technical support of National Informatics Centre (NIC). A total number of 3,549 computers were provided under the scheme to 3,241 agricultural produce markets (Annexure-I) up to March, 2013. Computers were also provided to State Agricultural Marketing Boards/ Directorates, etc. An application software package AGMARK, has been developed to facilitate organization and transmission of market data from the markets. 1.3 In order to strengthen interface with farmers and other beneficiaries, AGMARKNET portal (http://agmarknet.nic.in) has been developed. More than 2200 markets are regularly reporting price and arrivals related data which is being disseminated through the portal. The AGMARKNET portal also serves as a single window for accessing websites of various other organizations concerned with agricultural marketing. It provides weekly arrivals and price trend analysis for important markets in respect of major agricultural commodities transacted. It is also linked with Online Commodity Exchange of India Limited, providing futures prices in respect of oilseeds, crops, etc. International price trends of various agricultural commodities available on FAO website are also accessible through the portal. The portal is constantly being enriched. 1.4 During XI plan period 590 new market nodes were covered and replacements of computers for 574 old nodes were undertaken. Out of the existing 7,190 wholesale markets in the country, 3,241 i.e. 45 % had on-line facility under the scheme till the end of XI Plan. During XII Plan, 3,700 new markets are proposed to be covered under the network using mobile and SMS technology in addition to computers. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1 To establish a nation-wide information network for speedy collection and dissemination of market information and data for its efficient and timely utilization; 62 2.2 To facilitate collection and dissemination of information related to better price realization and market access by the farmers. This would cover: (i) Market related information such as market fee, market charges, costs, method of sale, payment, weighment, handling, market functionaries, development programmes, market laws, dispute settlement mechanism, composition of market committees, income and expenditure, etc. (ii) Price-related information such as minimum, maximum and modal prices of varieties and qualities transacted, total arrivals and dispatches with destination, marketing costs and margins, etc. (iii) Infrastructure related information comprising facilities and services available to the farmers with regard to storage and warehousing, cold storage, direct markets, grading, re-handling and repacking etc. (iv) Market requirement related information covering accepted standards and grades, labeling, sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, pledge finance, marketing credit and new opportunities available in respect of better marketing; 2.3 To sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new challenges in agricultural marketing by using ICT as a vehicle of extension; 2.4 To improve efficiency in agricultural marketing through regular training and extension for reaching region-specific farmers in their own language; and 2.5 To provide assistance for marketing research to generate marketing information for its dissemination to farmers and other marketing functionaries at grass-root level to create an ambience of good marketing practices in the country. 2.6 The information relating to the schemes in respect of agricultural marketing implemented by Government Departments and central agencies viz. Commerce, Food and Public Distribution, Consumer Affairs, Health and CCI, JCI, NCDC, NAFED, NTGF, TRIFED, NCCF, NDDB, NHB, APEDA, MPEDA will also be disseminated in user friendly manner. Once the farm produce is standardized and labelled, backed by quality certification, it can be directly offered for sale on Spot Exchange websites in national and international markets. 3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN : 3.1 The agencies involved in execution of the sub scheme are Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI), National Informatics Centre (NIC), State Governments through State Agriculture Marketing Boards (SAMBs)/ Directorates, other National and State level institutions and individual market committees/ authorities wherever applicable in the country. 3.2 Efforts will be made to involve private sector in collection of data and maintenance of the data base.

The concerned market nodes will arrange internet connectivity through local internet service provider. 63 3.4 It is proposed to also provide IT instruments such as mobile handsets etc. to the market nodes at principal market/ sub-market yard level through the State Implementing Agencies/other implementing agencies. 3.5 NICs role: NIC will develop required software applications, train market personnel in handling computer hardware and software, update the software package from time to time and develop and commission State level portals wherever requested. NIC will also arrange to harmonize/ integrate software packages used by the State Implementing Agencies and or any other Private Agency on their behalf for reporting data to the AGMARKNET Portal. It will continue to manage AGMARKNET portal and facilitate in updating of market information by the market nodes to the portal. Management of AGMARKNET/State level portals could be outsourced wherever considered necessary by respective competent authorities. In case of development of software applications, other than NIC, it could also be out sourced to private agencies, if and when required. 3.6 To improve the quality of data reporting on the portal, at DMI Headquarters, the AGMARKNET team will be strengthened from time to time by outsourcing professionals to monitor and constantly update the portal, in accordance with GFR provisions and with the prior approval of IFD 3.7 The State Implementing Agencies will provide to DMI the list of remaining markets to be covered for connectivity and replacement of old computers under the sub scheme. The State Implementing Agencies must ensure site readiness for successful installation and operation of the node which shall be verified and certified by concerned DMI Office.In case of those markets, where installing computers may be difficult, IT instruments such as mobile handsets or other instruments to harness mobile and sms/GPRS/2g/3G technology may be provided 3.8 Besides the existing system of reporting market information through use of computers in principal market yards, mobile/IT instruments based data reporting system will be introduced for both principal market yards and sub-market yards so as to facilitate collection of market information at grass root level at faster pace. For this, necessary APPS for such IT instruments like mobile handset etc. will be developed through NIC or through outsourcing. 3.9 Market node will collect and transmit relevant information to the State level and AGMARKNET portal. NIC/IT instrument Vendors would train 2 persons from each node in operating computer/mobile device and handling software package/APPS. The SAMB/Department will nominate a nodal officer to coordinate functioning of the node. The State level Nodal Officer will ensure that market level officials perform their functions regularly to keep the node operational. 3.10 The Data Reporting officials at the nodes and State level Nodal Officer will be incentivised for providing regular market data. 3.11 The instrument/device will be used for data uploading and any other official contact only and will be kept under the safe custody of the marketing personnel assigned the responsibility, who will be accountable for breakage/damage or any sort of mal functioning due to mishandling. In normal course, computers and mobile handset devices will be 64 replaced on the recommendation of the Sanctioning Committee, in five years in the case of computers and in three years in the case of mobile handsets. 3.12 A new version of GIS based Atlas will be expedited by NIC for content enrichment and the system will be put in place for regular data updating to make the portal more user friendly. 3.13 Electronic Display Boards / Price Ticker will be provided at every networked market for display of minimum and maximum price of important commodities including their arrivals. These efforts would be dovetailed, as far as possible, with the action being taken by the Forward Markets Commission under the sub scheme of the Department of Economic Affairs, state Agriculture Marketing boards or any other schemes of central/state governments including RKVY etc. 3.14 Strategic alliances will be developed with corporate, telecom players and private users for strengthening marketing intelligence services through sharing of AGMARKNET data and their dissemination to the farmers through SMS / Voice mail/apps through mobile Phones etc. Data collected may be shared with these agencies free of cost. 3.15 Facility will be developed on the portal for farmers to register for getting daily information on prices in nearby markets of their choice.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Grade Standards provide a common language for trade among growers, traders, processors etc. They provide a basis for incentive payment rewarding better quality. Farmers get prices commensurate with the quality produced by them. Grade standards help in electronic trading and issue of Negotiable Warehouse Receipt. The Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937 provides for framing of grade standards and their certification. SAGF sub scheme of the ISAM Scheme is an ongoing plan scheme to support grading and marking of agricultural produce, which involves framing of grade standards and certification of agricultural commodities included in the Schedule of the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937.SAGF sub scheme aims to help DMI implement the Act including meeting the expenditure for the purchase of equipment, chemicals, glassware and apparatus, Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) of the equipment as well as renovation and repair works in the Agmark laboratories/ Regional and Sub-offices of DMI. With this support, 11 Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central Agmark Laboratory, Nagpur are carrying out analysis of research samples and check samples for developing and promoting grading & standardization of agricultural commodities under Agmark. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1 The main objectives of the sub scheme are: 2.1.1 To help farmers get better and remunerative prices by grading of their produce. 2.1.2 To frame grade standards of agricultural commodities as per the provisions in Agricultural Produce ( Grading and Marking ) Act,1937. 2.1.3 To implement AGMARK certification programme for commodities for which grade standards are notified for domestic trade and for exports. 2.1.4 To analyse research samples for creating analytical data base for the framing /revision of grade standards of agricultural commodities. 3. Implementing Agency 3.1 Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) in the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, is the Nodal authority for certification of agricultural commodities including horticulture commodities under AGMARK. 74 4. Infrastructure for the Grading & Standardization Programme : 4.1 DMI has infrastructure of 11 Regional Offices and 26 Sub-offices spread all over the country to implement the certification programme. Head Office at Faridabad attends to the policy matters and framing/revision of standards based on the Reports of research projects carried out at Central Agmark Laboratory(CAL).Eleven Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) spread all over the country provide analytical support for the analysis of research samples and check samples drawn from the authorized packers premises and market. Central Agmark Laboratory at Nagpur is the apex laboratory. The RALs at Mumbai & Chennai and CAL at Nagpur are accredited with National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories (Department of Science & Technology) as per ISO/ IEC 17025. The RALs at Delhi, Jaipur, Kanpur,Kolkatta and Kochi are proposed to be accredited during the 12th Plan. 5. Framing and Revision of Grade Standards. 5.1 Framing of Grade Standards. Standards of agricultural commodities are framed in a scientific way. Basically it involves the following steps. 5.1.1 Agricultural commodity for which grade standards are to be framed is selected based on demand and necessity. 5.1.2 A sampling plan is prepared based on the areas in which the commodity is grown, processed and traded. 5.1.3 Physical and chemical parameters to determine the purity and quality of the commodity are identified. 5.1.4 Samples of the commodity are collected by the field offices from growing areas, whole sale and retail markets as per the sampling plan. 5.1.5 The samples are analysed in the Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central Agmark Laboratory of DMI for the identified parameters. 5.1.6 Analytical data obtained is statistically analysed and Central Agmark Laboratory suggests the limits of various quality parameters for different grades. 5.1.7 The specifications of the commodity prescribed in relevant Regulations of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and international standards viz. Codex Alimentarius Commission, ISO, etc. are consulted. 5.1.8 Draft standards are discussed with trade, industry and consumer organizations. 75 5.1.9 Preliminary Grading & Marking Rules for the Commodity are drafted and are vetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and published in the Gazette of India for inviting comments and suggestions from all stake holders. 5.1.10 The comments/suggestions received are considered and final notification is drafted, vetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and published in the Gazette of India. 5.2 Revision of Grade Standards: Grade Standards notified under the provisions of the Act are frequently revised to keep pace with the development of new varieties of agricultural commodities and technological advancements. 6. Harmonization of Grade Standards: 6.1 The grade standards are being harmonized with international standards such as Codex & ISO and standards framed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The grade standards of Codex, ISO, BIS and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India are consulted while framing the standards and revising them from time to time. Efforts are being made to have a single standard for raw agricultural commodities which is acceptable to all stakeholders viz. farmers, agricultural produce markets, commodity exchanges, retail chains, consumers, etc. 7. Focus on enhancement of income of the farmers: 7.1 The grade standards of 213 agricultural commodities have been notified under the provisions of the Act. These include raw, semi processed and processed commodities. Focus in the 12th plan will be on raw agricultural commodities such as cereals, pulses, oil seeds and fruits and vegetables so that farmers get incentive for grading the produce. Specific focus will be on the grade standards of fruits and vegetables and their grading and marking so that more countries recognize the Agmark certification system as already recognized by the European Union. The work of grading and marking of semi-processed and processed commodities where grading and marking of these commodities does not result into direct enhancement of income of the farmers, will be transferred to concerned Ministry/ Department. 8. Utilization of funds under the Sub Scheme: 8.1 The concerned RAL will procure its required equipment with approval of the competent authority and by following the GFR provisions. 8.2 For other components, provisions of GFR will be followed. All the components will be implemented as per delegated financial powers 9. Certification for Domestic Market: 76 9.1 The sub scheme for certification of agricultural commodities is voluntary as per the provisions of the Act. The persons desirous of certifying an agricultural commodity under AGMARK should have hygienic premises, necessary infrastructure to process and pack the commodity and have access to a well equipped laboratory for the estimation of prescribed parameters. The applicant for Certificate of Authorisation can either set up his own laboratory or have access to an approved State Grading Laboratory or Commercial Laboratory approved by the DMI for grading and marking of the commodities. The Chemist of the laboratory is trained in one of the Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) and is approved for carrying out grading and marking. Certificate of Authorisation ( C.A.) is granted to such parties on their request after they submit the required documents and their capacity to process and pack the commodity and hygienic conditions in the premises are ascertained. The approved Chemist of the C.A. holder analyses the processed commodity for determining the grade standard and gets it packed in his presence. 9.2 Check samples are drawn from premises of the authorised packers and market and these are analysed in RALs to keep check on the certification programme. Action to warn and suspend/cancel the Certificate of Authorisation is taken, if any, check sample is found not conforming to prescribed standards. 9.3 Use of technology will be made to enable C.A. holders and approved laboratories. The present outdated system of issuing replica serial numbers will be replaced by technology enabled system to minimize the human interaction between C.A. holders and officials and to make available these services on 24 by 7 basis. 10. Certification for Exports: DMI is attending to certification of many agricultural commodities for exports. Fruits and vegetables are important. European Commission has approved the conformity checking operations of DMI for pre shipment inspection for export of fresh fruits and vegetables to EU countries. Agricultural Marketing Adviser has been notified as Official Authority and DMI as inspection body for the purpose. Inspection and certification is voluntary. DMI is attending to certification of fruits and vegetables for exports through approved laboratories. 13 laboratories spread all over the country are approved to attend to grading and certification. Grapes, onions, okra and pomegranates are being certified for exports to EU countries. Efforts will be made that certification of agricultural commodities including fruits and vegetables is recognized by other countries also. 11. Revision of Guidelines relating to Agmark Certification Programme. The Guidelines for grant of Certificate of Authorisation for grading and marking of agricultural commodities for domestic market as well for exports and the Guidelines for approval of State Grading Laboratory/Cooperative/Association/Commercial Laboratory for grading and marking 77 for domestic grade and exports will be amended suitably in conformity with modern practices. 12. Physical Targets: 12.1 During the XII Plan period, it is proposed that all the standards will be aligned with BIS and FSSAI. Focus will be on grading primary agricultural produce so as to help farmers in augmentation of incomes. Those activities and semi-processed, processed products will be rationalized which dont result into direct benefits for the farmers, in consultation with BIS etc. It is proposed to analyse 54,000 check samples and 10,300 research samples. 13. Financial Outlay: 13.1 An amount of Rs.6.00 crores has been approved for the implementation of the sub scheme during the XII Plan period, subject to availability of funds as per following details: (Rs. in Crores) Head 201213 201314 201415 201516 201617 Total Machinery & Equipment 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.34 Supplies & Material 0.14 0.15 0.15 0.25 0.25 0.94 Minor Works 0.43 0.45 0.45 0.60 0.60 2.53 Advertising & Publicity 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.21 Wages 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.10 0.10 0.39 Other Administrative 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10 0.35 Expenses Office Expenses 0.16 0.15 0.15 0.28 0.28 1.02 Foreign Travel Expenses 0.02 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.22 Total 0.94 1.00 1.00 1.53 1.53 6.00 78 CHAPTER V AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH VENTURE CAPITAL ASSISTANCE AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILITY 1.

The agriculture marketing sector is today witnessing many challenges in the form of trade liberalisation, globalisation, diversification towards high value crops, changing market demands, etc., and therefore needs to become more responsive. Guiding the direction of change in agricultural marketing has become even more challenging. The main endeavour of the subscheme, through capacity building, conducting training, consulting solutions, education and policy advocacy, will be to escalate the agricultural marketing system in the country to a level where it can go hand in hand with the production and market sentiments. 2.

SALIENT FEATURES: 3.1 Capacity Building/ Training In order to impart quality training to different stakeholders the Institute needs to adopt an innovative approach and widen its horizon in terms of content, knowledge and methodology. In all, during XII Five Year Plan about 675 training programmes will be conducted. The Institute will focus on trainings with wider coverage, client orientation, research based training. 3.1.1 Wider Clientele Coverage: The client base will be increased by targeting national/ state level agencies serving agriculture and allied discipline such as State Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendra,, NGOs, Producers Organizations, Traders Association, elected members of physical markets, Commodity Boards, potential entrepreneurs and farmers, etc. 3.1.2 Target Oriented Course Module To encourage participation from various agencies including private sector target oriented course module will be developed. For this purpose, a training need assessment will be done on regular interval. Training modules imparted by NIAM will be repeatable every two-three years across the country. 3.1.3 Demand driven Training: NIAM will conduct demand driven certificate training courses of 3 to 6 months, in the field of Agri-business, Agri-Marketing etc. to cater to young, unemployed school dropouts to make them employable. NIAM will also consider tie-ups with companies/other organisations so that post-training absorption is 100%. NIAM may tie up with various partners consisting of IIM, SAU and other training institutes both in public and private sector to impart such training. Efforts will be made to make such training programs self financing and self sustainable in near future. 3.1.4 Research Based Trainings: To enhance the quality and practicability of the programme findings of research will be linked with training . Additionally, case studies will be conducted across regions to facilitate documentation of ground realities and for using the same for imparting training. 3.1.5 Developing linkages with the Stakeholder: Linkages will be established between the Institute and different stakeholders from Government as well as 105 corporate sector through workshops, buyers-sellers meet, management development programmes (MDPs), sensitization programme, etc. 3.1.6 International Collaboration in Capacity Building: The Institute would work as a knowledge centre for Asia and pacific region by developing coordination with the FAO and UNDP wherein these agencies will provide academic, technical, institutional and financial support. Similarly, the Institute may collaborate with the other international agencies working in the field of agricultural marketing, agri- business etc. through capacity building, research and faculty exchange programme. 3.2. Research Activities: 3.2.1 Applied research on various aspects of agricultural marketing and dissemination of knowledge is another noble objective of NIAM. NIAM will undertake and promote studies of applied research in problem areas of agricultural marketing and act as a nodal point for coordination of various research studies and dissemination of technologies relevant to agricultural marketing in the country. 3.2.2 NIAM will undertake research studies with focus on: (i) Management oriented case studies and use the findings of these in the training programme and education for strengthening the programmes . For this, NIAM may also collaborate with other institutions. Institutional arrangements will be suitably changed to accommodate such collaborative research. (ii) Research studies which address specific issues. (iii) Detailed study/documentation of each innovation and intervention in agri- marketing sector for the purpose of policy formulation and replication.

Market planning and designing to create state of art complex requires a professional approach. It not only requires designing and planning of a market at a particular place, but includes a holistic view of the agrarian scenario. In the present era of globalization, market planning and designing encompasses issues such as backward and forward linkage, quality and safety aspects, etc. This requires a broader, futuristic and integrated view of designing and planning, understanding, social parameters, flow variables, architectural concepts, commodity specific infrastructure etc. The consultancy assignments in the above mentioned areas will be taken up by the Institute. As the Government focuses on the increased participation of private players in the development of the sector specially in the creation of infrastructure and in provision of services, NIAM will in addition to consultancies from state government make efforts to get consultancies from corporate sectors. . 3.3.2 The consultancy division of the Institute will be strengthened through  (i) Widening the clientele base with inclusion of private sector (ii) Enhancing human resource as per the requirement of the assignment (iii) Collaboration with other national/ international agencies (iv) Properly defined guidelines for smooth implementation of the projects (v) Allocation of a portion of the revenue generated through consultancy towards faculty development fund as per norms and subject to prior approval of competent authority. (vi) Capacity building of the faculty (vii) Greater autonomy for utilization of revenue generated through consultancy. 3.3.3 NIAM would also arrange for consultancy services for setting up of a Project Development Facility to catalyze investment credit in agri-infrastructure projects 3.4 Education 3.4.1 The education mandate of NIAM aims at developing human resources by providing long-term structured courses in agricultural marketing through diploma courses. The post graduate diploma programme on agri-business management is well designed to meet the shortage of manpower for agri-business management in the country. This highly accredited course will continue to meet the demand for trained manpower in the sector. Presently the course curriculum of NIAM covers most of the issues in agri-business.
