Background & Strategy  Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) 1. Background and Strategy: 1.1 SMAE: Erstwhile Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) was being implemented under National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) w.e.f. 2014-15 which has been subsumed as a sub-scheme of Umbrella Scheme Krishonnati Yojana from the financial year 2017-18. Restructuring and strengthening of agricultural extension machinery has to be a judicious mix of extensive physical outreach of personnel, enhancement in quality through domain experts & regular capacity building, interactive methods of information dissemination, pervasive & innovative use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) / Mass Media, Federation of groups and convergence of extension related efforts under various schemes and programmes of Government of India and the State Governments. The objective of this Sub-Mission is to appropriately strengthen, expand and up-scale existing Extension Schemes. The on-going Extension Schemes include the Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes being implemented by the Extension Division/Directorate of Extension. Even in the case of Central Sector Schemes which are proposed to be subsumed within the Sub- Mission, a greater role has been envisaged for the States through their active involvement in planning, implementation and monitoring. The continuation of SMAE beyond 12th Plan period includes the following components:- A. Centrally Sponsored Scheme Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms(ATMA) Scheme. B. Central Sector Schemes (i). Agri-Clinics & Agri-Business Centre (AC&ABC); (ii) Kisan Call Centre (KCC); (iii) Mass Media Scheme in Agricultural Extension (MMSAE) including strengthening of Digital Agriculture Extension Framework; (iv) Diploma in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI); (v) Extension Education Institutes (EEIs); (vi) National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) merging NIAM; & (vii) Exhibition/Fairs.  II. SUPPORT TO STATE EXTENSION PROGRAMME FOR EXTENSION REFORMS (ATMA SCHEME GUIDELINES)  2. Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms (ATMA Scheme Guidelines) 2.1 INTRODUCTION: The extension system is an important pillar in agricultural development, to empower farmers with relevant information, technology, skills and support, all of which are necessary to enhance sustainability, farmers income and agriculture as an enterprise. Agriculture provides ample opportunities for the farmers to undertake several income generating agri-enterprises which are on-farm, off-farm and non-farm in nature. Agri-enterprises include nursery, seed production, custom hiring, vermi- composting, bee-keeping, managing common storage, processing units, agri- tourism, milk chilling unit, mushroom cultivation etc. require skills, investment and market linkages. Income addition to farmers through these activities contributes significantly for doubling income not only for the enterprising farmer but also for others who use these quality inputs and services. Extension also needs to focus on these areas so as to create the Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) at Village level. Thus, extension services require re-aligning themselves with Crop Diversification, Integrated Farming System, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Natural Farming, Market-Led Extension, Risk Management, in both production and marketing for sustainable crop production. In order to increase outreach of extension services to large number of farmers and addressing their four common concepts, viz. what to grow?, how to finance?, what input to use? and where & how to sell?, an urgent need was felt to further upscale the existing extension initiatives and revamp the main public extension scheme, i.e. Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA). Need for reforms in Agricultural Extension have been explicitly raised in the report of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI) by 2022. Keeping the recommendations of the DFI report and policy initiatives in view and to strengthen and make ATMA scheme more vibrant, a futuristic vision has been developed to empower the farmers. 2.2 VISION To empower farmers with information, technology, skill, risk and farm management practices across agriculture sub-sectors and commodity specific agriculture value chains, so as to enable them to realize higher net income from their enterprises on a sustainable basis.  2.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES a. The Scheme Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms popularly known as ATMA scheme, aimed at promoting decentralized, farmer friendly extension system in the country with an objective to support State Governments efforts to revamp the agricultural extension system focusing on Natural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop Diversification, National Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card, Digital Agriculture Mission and making available the latest agricultural technologies and good agricultural practices to the farmers. b. Keeping in view the changed focus of ATMA scheme, the objectives of the scheme have been revised as under :- i) More emphases of extension services on post-production management, surplus management and marketing. ii) To converge extension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW in ATMA Cafeteria. iii) Convergence between research and extension. iv) Extension outreach to farmers through Video Conferencing. v) Skill Development Training of Rural Youth (minimum 200 hours). vi) To promote climate resilient agriculture, according to requirement of various agro-climatic zone. vii) Adopting group approach to extension in line with the identified needs and requirements of the farmers in the form of CIGs/FIGs/FSGs and consolidate them as FPOs. viii) Addressing gender concerns by mobilizing women farmers into groups for their capacity building ix) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) based farmers training. 2.4 CHANGES IN THE EXISTING ATMA SCHEME In order to accomplish the vision, guiding elements of DFI report and key objectives/reforms, the following changes have been made in the Scheme:- 2.4.1 Production to Market Orientation: Focus of extension services will be given on marketing aspects along with a quality production. Farmers training shall be organized on the themes of Post-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Agriculture Marketing, various initiatives of Government, etc. For ensuring implementation of activities with changed focus towards marketing, States may take up the following steps:- i. All extension personnel (ATMA & Non-ATMA) are targeted to be trained in market led extension training programmes. The training modules on market led extension for field functionaries and farmers have been developed which may be seen in Annexure-VI & Annexure-VII respectively.  ii. Farmers training programmes (within District) under the scheme henceforth shall be two days duration. Training module shall include RPL based farmers training followed by their up-skilling. A certificate of progressive farmers will be provided to them on successful completion of the training programme. Such farmers trainings shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats. In special cases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a larger scale. The certified progressive farmers are expected to disseminate acquired knowledge and skill among their fellow farmers. The concept of RPL may be seen at Annexure-XII. 2.5. Converge Extension Activities of various Divisions of Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) in ATMA Cafeteria: Extension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW have been identified and made these eligible to converge in ATMA cafeteria. These identified thematic areas include Post-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Marketing, Diversification, Integrated Farming System, Seed Production& Seed Technology, Integrated Development of Horticulture, Soil Health Management, Integrated Pest Management, Agricultural Mechanization, Micro Irrigation, etc. Duration and cost norms along with certification may be as per specified guidelines of respective schemes of various Divisions of DA&FW. 2.6 Convergence of Extension with Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying: Services of Krishi Sakhis & Pashu Sakhis nurtured by DAY-NRLM may be suitably used for creating awareness among the farmers under ATMA Scheme after providing them training in relevant subjects. 2.7 Convergence between Research and Extension: In order to implement convergence circular jointly signed by the DG, ICAR & the Secretary (AC&FW) in letter and spirit, a convergence matrix has been prepared for reporting/monitoring with quantifiable targets as per details given below :- a. Monthly Interface Meeting b. Pre-seasonal Technical Updation c. Farmer-Scientist Interactions at District level d. Designating Experts at District level for instant technical help of ATM/BTM e. Joint Visits in identified villages by ATMA and KVK f. Reporting and Monitoring mechanism. States may ensure regular implementation and reporting of progress on convergence between research and extension on the above matrix. The detailed guidelines regarding convergence may be seen in the Chapter No. IV.  2.8 Extension through Interaction: In order to provide greater opportunities of interaction between farmers and experts on regular basis, a mechanism of Video Conferencing for interaction between experts and farmers shall be made as an eligible activity under ATMA cafeteria. 2.09 Skill Development Training of Rural Youth (Minimum 200 hours): In order to enhance self-employment opportunities and entrepreneurship development in agriculture and allied sectors, Skill Training for Rural Youth component is being included in ATMA. This component was earlier implemented from RKVY funding and skill trainings were conducted through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs). As per revised Guidelines, the District ATMA to implement this component in consultation with respective KVK. 2.10 Promotion of Innovative ATMA set-up based on Agro-Ecological Zones: In order to improve mechanism of agricultural extension system in the country, States may consider various innovative and flexible ideas like organising ATMA activities agro-ecological zones in a district. States may consider such innovative ideas based on the agro-ecological zones in each district prescribing farmers to adopt appropriate technologies and cropping patterns. Manpower support under the scheme, however, shall not exceed the maximum permissible limit, based on the number of administrative districts in State. III. ATMA Set-up & Human Resource (HR) 3.1 ATMA set-up at different levels is given below:- 3.1.1 State Level (i) The State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is the apex body to approve State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) which will form a part of the State Agriculture Plan (SAP). In those cases where SLSC meeting cannot be held in time or there is any other administrative reason, SEWP can be approved by the Executive Committee of SMAE on the recommendation of Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG). (ii) The SLSC may be supported by the IDWG which is responsible for day-to-day coordination and management of the Scheme activities within the State.  (iii) The State Nodal Cell (SNC), consisting of State Nodal officer, State Coordinator, Gender Coordinator and supporting staff (Computer Programmer & Accountant- cum-Clerk) will ensure timely receipt of District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs), formulation of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) duly incorporating farmers feedback obtained through State Farmer Advisory Committee (SFAC) and its approval by the SLSC. The SNC will then convey the approval and monitor implementation of these work plans by State Agricultural Management & Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs) and ATMAs. The SAMETIs will draw- up and execute an Annual Training Calendar for capacity building of the Extension Functionaries in the State. While doing so, the SAMETI will check duplication and overlapping of training content, training schedule, and trainees themselves. The SAMETIs table to ensure effective coordination with MANAGE, Hyderabad for finalizing the Annual Training Calendar through their participation and indepth discussion in the National annual Training Planning Workshop at MANAGE involving all the stakeholders. 3.1.2 District Level ATMA is an autonomous institution set up at district level to ensure delivery of extension services to farmers. ATMA Governing Board is the apex body of ATMA which provides overall policy direction. ATMA Management Committee is the executive body looking after implementation of the scheme. District Farmers Advisory Committee is a body to provide farmers feedback for district level planning and implementation. With dedicated staff provided for the ATMA, it will continue to be the district level nodal agency responsible for overall management of agriculture extension system within the district, including preparation of Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP). The process flow for formulating Action Plans has been described in Para 3.2 below. 3.1.3 Block Level The Block ATMA Cell consisting of Block Technology Team (BTT) (a team comprising officers of agriculture and other allied departments within the block) and Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) (a group exclusively consisting of selected farmers of the block) will prepare the Block Action Plan (BAP) and provide necessary extension support within the Block in its execution. 3.1.4. Village Level (i) The Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system and farmers at village level (one for every two villages). (ii) Agri-entrepreneurs, Diploma holders in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI), Input Dealers and extension workers in non-  governmental sector will supplement the efforts of extension functionaries in public extension system. (iii)Commodity Interest Groups (CIGs), Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) and Food Security Groups (FSGs) will serve as a nodal point for information & technology dissemination among its members and federating in Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs) to ensure group approach. (iv) Farm Schools will serve as a mechanism for farmer-to-farmer extension at every Block. 3.1.5. The organizational structure at various levels has been depicted in the following diagram: DAC&FW MANAGE/EEIs/ SAUs/ICAR STATES (HRD/ACABC/ DAESI)/ EXHIBITIONS State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC)/ IDWG SAMETI & SAU/ICAR State State Farmers Advisory F Institutes NodalCell Committee W U O N R District Farmers Advisory D District Training ATMA K Committee Centre, KVK & ZRS (GB & MC) F P L O BlockTechnology Team Block Block Farmers Advisory L ATMA cell Committee A W N Farmer Agri-Entrepreneurs Farm Schools Friend CIGs, FIGs, FSGs, FARMERS, FPOs 3.1.6. The following Committees shall be set up at various levels.  State Level: (i) Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) (ii) SAMETI Executive Committee (iii) State Farmers Advisory Committee (SFAC)  District Level: (i) ATMA Governing Board (ii) ATMA Management Committee (iii)District Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC)  Block Level: (i) Block Technology Team (BTT) (ii)Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC)  The composition, functions and mandate of these Committees have been given at Annexure III (a) to III (f). 3.2. Process Flow for Action Plans SREP is a comprehensive document identifying research/extension priorities of the district, keeping in mind agro-ecological situations and existing gaps in technology generation & dissemination in all agriculture and allied sector areas/activities including Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries. All extension related activities under other schemes of DA&FW would naturally form part of SREP. SREPs will be prepared in coordination with the line departments, NGOs, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), Private Sector, farmers and other stakeholders at the district level. Similar training & field extension related components in other programmes of DA&FW and State Governments will also be implemented through ATMA. Funds earmarked for such activities under different Schemes/ Programmes will be utilized through ATMA. Similarly, ATMA funds also will be suitably used to cover training & field extension objectives/activities of other Schemes/ Programmes. Such convergence arrived at through SREP/ SEWP will avoid duplication and ensure wider coverage in terms of outreach to farmers and gamut of activities. Various Action Plans shall emanate from SREP as follows: (i) These SREPs are Five-year vision documents which shall be revisited after every 5 years to accommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas of importance viz. market plan based on cross-sector value chain approach, skill development, agri start-ups and off-farm income generating options. (ii) SREPs will form the basis for formulation of Block Action Plans (BAPs) on an annual basis. Block Action Plans are then consolidated at the District level to prepare the District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs). (iii) The DAAPs will be consolidated in the form of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) which then forms a part of consolidated Annual Action Plan (AAP) under KY. 3.3. ATMA Human Resource provided at different levels is given below: For ensuring effective implementation of the scheme at the grass root level and addressing the need of the farmers, provision of a robust and dedicated specialist and extension functionaries has been made in the scheme. The details of manpower support provided are given below:-  a) Over 28,000 posts of extension functionaries have been provided under the scheme at the state, district and block level. b) Remuneration of those field functionaries has been enhanced, whose rremuneration was not revised since 2014-15 onwards. This may certainly motivate ATMA functionaries and accelerate implementation of the Scheme activities on the ground. c) Average 3 Assistant Technology Managers (ATMs) and 1 Block Technology Manager (BTM) are envisaged per block under this scheme. Detailed justification for deciding number of ATMs in a Block may be seen in para 3.3.3(ii). d) Extension related manpower is proposed at three levels viz. State, District and Block level.

The duties & responsibilities of PD & Deputy PD Accountant-cum-Clerk and Computer Programmer/Operator are given at Annexure-IV (b). 3.3.3 Block Level: (i) One Block Technology Manager (BTM) is provided in each Block to co- ordinate the ATMA related activities of the BTT and BFAC. BTM will work  under the overall supervision of the BTT Convener for all ATMA related activities at the Block level. (ii) On an average three Assistant Technology Managers (ATMs) are to be placed in each Block (2 to 4 depending on size of the Block) exclusively for delivery of extension services in agriculture and allied sectors as per priority areas for various Blocks. Out of 3 ATM, at least one ATM should be Women. (a) In N.E. States and other hilly States viz. H.P., J&K, and Uttarakhand, the number of ATMs deployed per block should be based on the criteria i.e. Blocks having upto 5000 farm households and the area of the Block being upto 800 sq. kms, 2 ATMs would be deployed. However, if the area of the Block is more than 800 sq.km, 3 ATMs could be considered; (b) In all other States Blocks having upto 12000 farm households and the area of the Block being upto 1000 sq. km, 2 ATMs would be deployed. However, if the number of farm households/Block exceeds 20000 and the area of the block is more than 1000 sq.km, the deployment of ATM can go up to 4. All other Blocks will have 3 ATMs. However, average figure of more than 3 ATMs per state will need to be concurred by the Government of India, so that overall country average does not exceed 3. (c) The areas of expertise (i.e. Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries etc.) of these ATMs will be decided based on priorities for various Blocks. These ATMs shall be provided requisite connectivity and mobility to perform the assigned functions. The duties of BTMs and ATMs are given at Annexure IV (b). (d) Block level and District level manpower available under various schemes will be pooled for regular coverage of groups of Villages/Panchayats for extension related expertise. However, domain expertise of various extension personnel in a Block/District will be suitably used to ensure all-round outreach to farmers. 3.4 Mode of Recruitment and Remuneration: 3.4.1 The BTMs and ATMs at Block Level may be engaged by Project Director (PD), ATMA on contractual /outsource basis through a mechanism identified by the State. BTMs and ATMs should be preferably below 45 years of age (upper age limit of 45 years would, however, not be applicable on those candidates who have already served as BTM/ ATM as they have gained working experience under the scheme), as their work involves extensive travel execution of field activities. While, the ATMs will remain  under the administrative control of BTM, the BTM will work under administrative control of PD, ATMA. 3.4.2 The posts of State Coordinator, Gender Coordinator, BTM & ATM at Block level and Computer Programmer/Computer Operator (at State & District Level) may be filled on contractual /outsource basis with lump-sum remuneration. 3.4.3 Following emoluments are suggested to be paid to the contractual / outsourced manpower: 1. State Coordinator: Rs 60,000/- 2. Gender Coordinator: Rs.50,000/- 3. BTM: Rs.30,000/- 4. ATM Rs 25,000/- 5. Computer Programmer Rs 25,000/- 3.4.4 All other posts (Director SAMETI, Deputy Director SAMETI, PD ATMA, DPD ATMA and Accountant cum Clerk) may be filled by deputation / secondment / appointment for the scheme period or such other mode as the State Government may deem appropriate. State government may take necessary measures to fill up these posts / vacancies by deputation/secondment/appointment only. Henceforth, regular posts may not be filled on contractual/outsource basis. However, States(UTs may retain their existing deployed manpower filled on contract basis viz. Accountant-cum- clerk, Dy. Project Director (ATMA), Dy. Director SAMETI revising their remuneration to Rs. 30,000/ , Rs. 52,000/- and Rs. 55,000/- per month respectively w.e.f. 01.04.2025 till the time these vacancies are filled on regular basis. 3.4.5 Following norms regarding contractual/outsourced manpower may be followed: (i) Concerned contractual/outsourced/regular persons may be given the stipulated emoluments through digital/online mode of payment. (ii) The contractual/outsourced manpower shall also be eligible for getting benefits of EPF, ESIC as admissible from time to time as per prevalent laws & instructions and/or options exercised by the stakeholders concerned. GST, statutory dues, bonus if applicable, as per relevant statutory norms, and contractors margins are to be indicated separately under the expenses shown for manpower component. While renewing the contract, the State Government may give preference to the existing/experienced contractual / outsourced manpower and do not terminate their services without assigning any reason. States may consider contractual /outsourced manpower deployment co-terminus with the scheme. Satisfaction of the Agriculture Department of the State at an appropriate level may be the determining factor regarding continuation of persons after initial period of deployment.  (iii) Annual increase in the remuneration of contractual/outsourced ATMA manpower : Rate for annual increase can be upto 5% for those contractual/outsourced manpower who have already crossed the revised initial ceiling and upto 10% for those contractual/outsourced manpower who have not yet crossed the revised initial ceiling. For example : in case a Computer Programmer (CP) deployed in 2014 with the existing monthly remuneration @ Rs.16,000/- (fixed in 2014) is presently getting gross monthly emoluments more than revised initial ceiling of Rs.25,000/-, he / she will be eligible for getting an annual increase @ upto 5% (flat and not compounding) while a CP who is presently getting only say Rs.18,000/- per month ( i.e. less than the revised initial ceiling ) will be eligible for getting an annual increase @ upto 10% (flat and not compounding), till he/she reaches up to the revised initial ceiling. Note: a) Higher amounts to existing contractual/outsourced manpower are payable only after performance review and screening on the lines described above. While fixing total emoluments to contractual/outsourced manpower of any post at enhanced rate, emoluments should not be less than total emoluments last paid to contractual/outsourced manpower. b) The amounts listed above are upper ceilings for initial fixation of emolument and the State Governments may consider fixing the emoluments accordingly. (iv) If, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the candidates for various posts with prescribed qualifications as given at Annexure-IV(c) are not available, the qualifications may be relaxed by the IDWG subject to ratification by the SLSC under intimation to the Government of India. (v) Leave/maternity leave etc. to contractual/outsourced ATMA manpower may be considered by the States/UTs at par with similarly placed contractual / outsourced manpower in other organizations in the State/UT concerned. 3.4.6 Support for Innovative Activity at Village Level (Farmer Friend) (i) It is necessary to identify and groom progressive farmers (including women farmers) with requisite qualification (Senior Secondary/High School) & experience as Farmer Friend (FF), one per two census villages. In case of non-availability of progressive farmers with requisite qualifications, at some places, a progressive farmer, with  required oral and written communication skills, may be considered. Only experienced and achiever farmers (say, with an age of more than 40 years or so, as the State Government may deem appropriate) are to be designated as Farmer Friends. Preference may be given to awardee/progressive farmers while identifying farmer friend. Farmer Friend will lead by example and is expected to have up-graded skills and would be available in the village to advice on agriculture and allied activities. Since FFs provide a vital link between public extension system and farmers at village level, it is essential to select experienced, progressive and practicing farmers who are not looking forward to this task as an alternative means of livelihood. The Farmer Friend will be identified by BTM on a resolution of Gram Panchayat (GP), which will, in turn, consult CIGs/FIGs working in the Panchayat area. (ii) Farmer Friends will be provided with special opportunity for upgradation of skills through trainings, study tours and visits to SAUs/other institutes, by utilizing support available under ATMA. Rs.18,000/- per Farmer Friend per year will be shared between the Centre and the State as per pattern of assistance approved for all other activities under the scheme to meet contingency expenditure which FF incurs towards discharge of his duties, including incidental expenses incurred on acquisition of knowledge. It should not be perceived as remuneration. It is to clarify that identification of Farmer friends should not be seen as an employment opportunity in the State Government and this was never envisaged under the scheme. IV. CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES ATMA CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES: In order to implement extension activities with special focus on post-harvest management, marketing, etc. as recommended by the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI) by 2022, various extension activities are to be carried out at different levels addressing national priority areas (Annexure-I) suitably contributing in the national goal of doubling of farmers income. Extension services are being re-aligned with sustainability aspects of farming, for crop diversification, integrated farming system, climate resilient agriculture, risk management, Natural Farming in both production and marketing. Additional/innovative extension activities have included to be implemented under ATMA scheme, viz. extension through interaction etc., at Panchayat/Village level for providing door-step services and dissemination of information on Government schemes to farmers.  Unit cost and Activity ceiling limit norms of various Cafeteria activities under ATMA have been revised and indicated at Annexure-V (a). The Cafeteria provides support for State, District and Block level activities. Apart from the national priority areas/thematic areas, States may also choose local area/theme in keeping with location specific needs of farmers for their capacity building as identified in Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) of the District. The details of activities at different levels are given below:- 4.1 State Level (A): A.1 Monitoring and Evaluation: This activity includes three review workshops and R-E-F Linkage before each crop season (Rabi, Kharif and Zaid) on annual basis @ 1.00 lakh per workshop, concurrent monitoring & evaluation and expenses on IDWG meetings and other contingencies including opex for SNC, SC, GC including expenditure on convening meeting of SFAC. A.2 Training Courses: This item includes training programmes for National/Inter- State/Within State (SAMETI Level) for both Government and Non- Government extension functionaries (A.2.a), Induction Training of ATMA field functionaries (A.2.b), Refresher training of all ATMA field functionaries (A.2.c), Workshop for development of Quality Resource material (A.2.d).One DPD out of two at District level and one ATM out of three at Block level are to be essentially trained in marketing in order to acquaint them with market expertise. A.3 Exposure Visit of Extension functionaries: In order to enhance capacity building and expertise of extension functionaries, a provision of their exposure visit and PRI members to progressive States have been made in the guidelines.

B.1 Development of SREP: Strategic Research Extension Plan (SREP) is essential for formulating State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) and annual action Plan(AAP). This document is prepared adopting integrated farming system approach, where extension and research gaps of all the sub-systems are identified through participatory methods. SREP is re-visited after every five years to accommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas. The committee on DFI has since recommended paradigm shift from production to market-led-extension, States may include new areas in revised SREP like market-led-extension,mitigate crop loses, Skill Development, agri-start- ups and income generating livelihood options. B.2 Farmers Training: Farmers Training is an important component of capacity building of farmers in latest agriculture technologies and adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs). Farmers Training would focus on thrust areas like Natural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop Diversification, National Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card, Digital Agriculture Mission etc. In order to maintain quality of farmers training, farmers training shall be conducted in the specialized subject matter institutions viz: ICAR Institutes/ State Agriculture Universities/State Agricultural Management & Training Institutes/ MANAGE/ EEIs and KVKs etc. [Annexure-V(a)]. i. Under Inter-State and within State training of farmers activity, cost norms are inclusive of : (i) Travel cost by bus or second class sleeper (actual cost); (ii) Refreshments/Meals and Stay during training, (iii) Expenditure on training, training material; (iv) Training kit and agricultural inputs, if any; (v) Cost of honorarium and/or travel of the trainer (actual); (vi) Miscellaneous food cost during travel, if any, and(vii) Field visits etc. ii. The amounts indicated in the cafeteria are top activity ceilings and only the actual cost should be paid after exercising economy. The Progress Reports should contain only these actual amounts. Any deviation from  these cost norms of training under items B.2 (a) to (c) should be got approved by the IDWG which includes States Finance Secretary. In case of within district farmers training, likely expenditure or State/location specific cost norms needs to be got approved in advance by the ATMA Governing Board. iii. Duration of the farmers training for inter-state, intra-State shall be 7days & 5 days respectively, excluding journey time. Farmers training programmes (within District) under the scheme would be 2 days duration and these shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats. In special cases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a larger scale. iv. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that all panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of farmers is not permissible, except when theme of training is different. Other guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in Chapter-VII. v. States shall develop module for these farmers training in consultation with domain experts. Training module shall include recognizing the Prior learning of farmers followed by their up-skilling by way of training. A certificate of progressive farmers will be provided to them on successful completion of the training programme. The certified progressive farmers are expected to disseminate acquired knowledge and skill among their fellow farmers. Farmer Trainings may be organized by ATMA through respective domain experts of ICAR/KVKs, SAUs, National/State level Institutes, Government agencies and specialized Institutes etc. vi. The identified thematic areas of farmers training include: National Priority Areas/Themes:- (i) Post-harvest management (ii) Organic production clusters (iii) Market led extension (iv) Seed production and seed technology aspects (v) Integrated farming, climate resilient cropping system, adaptation and good agricultural practices. (vi) Integrated pest management practices in major crops (vii) Holistic growth of Horticulture sector covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cocoa and bamboo.

B.3 Demonstrations: i. Demonstration with an embedded philosophy of seeing is believing is an important extension activity to teach new knowledge and skills to farmers. Demonstration shall be organized in those areas which have not been covered under other Schemes / Missions / Sub-Missions of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Notified varieties for climate resilient agriculture and bio-fortified varieties of different crops would be promoted through these extension activities. Appropriate publicity should be accorded to the Demonstration and Farm Schools so that benefits can reach to the large number of farmers. A provision of Rs.6,000/- per acre is made under the scheme for one demo (Photographs of the event will be uploaded on Krishi Mapper). This provision shall be used for soil testing , seeds of improved variety of crops, fertilizer, IPM, display board etc. Selected farmer may also organize a controlled plot demonstration of 1 acre at his own cost, so that a comparison can be drawn. Soil Testing /Soil Health Card is mandatory for conducting Demonstration. ii. Demonstration shall be organized in a plot of 1 acre land, at place easily approachable/accessible to other farmers. There should be a prominent display board at the selected plot indicating the details of demonstration activity. iii. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that all panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of  farmers is not permissible, except when crop of demonstration is different. Other guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in Chapter-IX. iv. For wider dissemination and increased outreach, State is expected to suitably popularize the demonstration activity among the targeted farmers. State may use various modes of publicity for reaching large number of farmers. B.4 Exposure Visits of Farmers: The exposure visits of farmers to exemplary farms either inter-state, within state and within district are considered as the best form of learning from new farming practices and modern, scientific and innovative farm technologies. Exposure visits of farmers will be conducted in national / international/ regional/ state and district level Agri-Fairs wherein advanced agriculture technologies are show-cased for creating awareness among large number of farmers.Travel and staying together with fellow farmers affords more time and is a good opportunity to share each others experiences and establish rapport, which can result in actual adoption. The cost norms for inter-state, within state and within district exposure visits for farmers of General/NER States per manday are indicated in cafeteria table. B.5 Mobilization of Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs): Group approach is central to the restructured extension mechanism to make extension more demand-driven. ATMA is envisaged as a very effective instrument for promoting participatory planning and group based approaches with focus on learning and empowerment. The aim is to redirect extension activities towards diversification into high value crops and products thereby increasing farm income and rural employment. With this market-driven approach to extension, it was envisaged that the ATMA body will make efforts to promote group of farmers and organize them around specific crops for commodities. These village level FIGs/CIGs are to be ultimately federated at Block/District level such as Block Level Farmers Association, District Level Farm Federations, etc. so as to make the technology generation/dissemination farmer-driven and farmer- accountable. A provision of Rs.10,000/- per FIG has been provided for mobilization of 1 group of 20 farmers and Rs.25,000/- as seed money (revolving fund) for viable FIG/CIG. There is a capping of 20 groups per  block per year. FIGs/CIGs/FSGs are required to be federated as Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs). Women Food Security Groups (B.5.c): Rural women play a very important role in agriculture. As such, it is proposed that ATMA should lay focus and address womens issues through special interventions. To ensure food and nutritional security at the household level, it is proposed to support promotion of Farm womens Food Security Groups (FSGs). These FSGs would be provided support for training, publication and access to inputs @ Rs.25,000/- per group. It is proposed that minimum 2 FSGs per Block per year is mandated under the scheme. These FSGs would serve as Model Food Security Hubs through establishing kitchen garden, backyard poultry, goatery, animal husbandry & dairying, mushroom cultivation, etc. These groups would essentially be provided input support including small tools, seeds, planting material for setting up backyard food security garden @ Rs.25,000/- per group. B.6 Farmer Awards: To incentivize best farmers representing different enterprises, a provision of Rs.10,000/- per farmer per year has been made. State may device a transparent mechanism to select the best farmers in relevant enterprise involving technical and scientific agencies. In identifying potential awardees, preference may be given to the farmers recognized for their production/productivity or progressive farmers recognized for their innovative farming practices. These individuals may be actively involved at block or village-level activities such as Farm Schools and other local agricultural initiatives, contributing to the communitys development and knowledge sharing. B.7 to B.9 Farm Information Dissemination through exhibitions, Mass Media, publication: This includes local level agricultural exhibitions, low cost publications, information dissemination through printed materials and development of technology packages in electronic form. The cost norms of these activities may be seen in Annexure-V(a). B.10 to B.12 Agriculture Technology Refinement, Validation and Adoption This includes to designate expert for each District from the Scientists of KVKs/SAUs, organization of Farmer-Scientist Interaction at local level, joint visits by scientist and extension personnel for which substantial financial provision has been made in the cafeteria, organization of Field- days and Kisan Goshthies and assessment, refinement, validation & adoption for frontline technologies and other short term researchable  issues through KVKs and other local research centres. Cost norms of these activities are clearly indicated in the cafeteria. While designating District level experts from KVKs/SAUs, only those Scientists may be considered who have already participated in carrying out Farmers- Scientists-Interaction (FSIs) activity. Farmer Friend (FF) and Agri-Advisors (AAs) should also be involved actively in FSIs. B.13 Administrative expenses:- As per details given in cafeteria. B.14 Farm Schools :- (i)An important means to upgrade the process of dissemination of information in agriculture and allied sector is farmer-to-farmer approach, which is found to be very pertinent. The key feature of the Farm Schools being promoted under ATMA is that at least three Farm Schools to be set up in each Block in the field of outstanding or achiever farmers. Farm Schools and Farm School Trainers for each season would be finally approved by the ATMA GB; main activities of Farm Schools would be to operationalize frontline demonstrations in one hectare land in one or more crops/allied sector activities. Farm Schools would provide season long technical backstroking/training to target farmers by having an interactive session one at least during each of the four critical stages in a cropping season. 50% representation may be given to small and marginal farmers while selecting the trainees of the Farm Schools. Now, Farm Schools (FS) will be organized in two models viz: Model I- at Progressive Farmers field @ Rs.32,400/FS and Model-II - at Awardee farmers field @ Rs.20,200/FS. Number of Critical stages have been reduced from existing Six to Four stages namely (i) Crown Root Initiation, (ii) Tillering, (iii) Flowering and (iv) Milk & Dough stage. (ii) The detailed concept of Farm School and item-wise cost norms may be seen in Annexure-V(b). B.15 Farmer Friend: The Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system and farmers at village level (one for every two villages). An amount of Rs.18,000/- per annum is payable to a farmer friend as a contingency amount.  C Innovative Activities: In order to encourage States for taking up innovative work in extension, it is proposed to provide Rs.25.00 lakh at State level and at District level @ Rs.0.50 lakh per block. For taking up innovative activities at State and District level, approval/rectification in the IDWG meeting would be required. Various innovative activities include: C.1 PG Diploma in Agricultural Extension Management or Agricultural Marketing Management :- PGDAEM or PGDAMM for in-service extension functionaries continue to be implemented through MANAGE/NIAM releasing central share directly to MANAGE. C.2 Innovative Activities-State level C.3 Innovative Activities-District level C.4 SETTING UP OF COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS (CRSs) i. Community Radio Stations (CRS) have to be promoted in a big way to expand the reach of localised technologies to the farmers located within a radius of 20 to 50 Kilometers. ii. A total amount of not more than Rs.65 lakh (including capital and recurring cost) is proposed to be provided as assistance for CRS spread over operational period.There will be a ceiling of Rs.14.50 lakh on the capital cost but the same can be reviewed if substantially higher range than the present standard of 20 Kms. radius is proposed to be covered. Support for content creation at a rate not exceeding Rs.3,500/-per hour normally with a diminishing support structure of 730,540 and 200 hours respectively for first, second and third year will be provided. Some NGOs and KVKs may also use innovative technologies meeting minimum system requirement or contribution from some private players to reduce the capital cost. Subject to compliance of minimum technical specification for setting up of Community Radio Station, break-up of Rs.65.00 lakh is permitted to be changed from capital cost to recurring cost or recurring cost from one year to another. If cost of production can be reduced without diluting quality norms or there is some other financial support like advertisement, revenue or part of capital cost is diverted to recurring expenditure or a time lag between setting-up of CRS and start of  programmes, recurring cost also can be taken to even beyond three years subject to overall cost ceiling. Further, year-wise cost ceilings per CRS have been given in the Cafeteria of Activities (D.2) iii. Funding to private institutions along with Government and Quasi- government organizations for setting up Community Radio Stations (CRSs) can be considered. iv. Community based organizations, Agencies/NGOs registered under Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other such Act and recognized by the Central Government/State Government and serving in Agriculture and allied areas including SAUs and/KVKs are eligible for funding. Registration at the time of application should be at least three years old. v. The willing Organizations should have basic infrastructure and facilities in the form of a room of about 400 sq. feet/ electricity/ necessary manpower to run and operate the CRSs. vi. ATMA MC of the District concerned may select suitable proposal/s; recommend them to the Nodal Officer/Commissioner of Agriculture of the concerned State for onward transmission to DAC through the competent committee, i.e., the IDWG having representation of SAU/ICAR Institutes/KVKs concerned so that the proposals are not referred again to ICAR by I&B Ministry which causes a considerable delay in granting approvals. vii. The PD, ATMA would regularly review the performance of CRSs along with other activities with the BTMs. In addition, ATMA GB would review the performance in detail with regard to content creation, involvement of local community, suitability to local conditions, release/utilization of funds for/by CRS and convergence & synergy with SAU/KVKs. viii. Any organization already sought CRS funding for 3 years will not be eligible for funding again under the Scheme. D Manpower Support Details are given in chapter-III of this Guidelines and initial monthly remuneration rates mentioned in Activity D of ATMA Cafeteria,2025.  B11(a) Farmer Scientist Interactions at District level Farmer Scientist interactions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers concerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help in bringing forth various technological options for the coming season which is suited to the local situations. ATMA Cafeteria provides for Farmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2 days @Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 3 such interactions, one before each crop season per year may be organised in each district with active involvement of local KVK, SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the district. B11(b) Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Joint visits by the PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level KVK/SAU/ICAR scientists greatly helps in creating a common understanding of field level technological issues and providing an integrated solution to the problems faced by the farmers. In order to ensure proper mobility for field visits of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provided under ATMA cafeteria for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/- per visit per district. A.9 Extension through Interaction : In order to provide greater opportunities of interaction between farmers and experts on regular basis, a mechanism through constitution of expert committees is proposed at State and National levels with involvement of domain experts of Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries, Veterinary, Sericulture and Agricultural Marketing, weather & meteorology etc. including those from banking and insurance sector. For answering farmers queries and to resolve their problems from a single platform on a regular basis, it is proposed to put in place two Committees viz. State Level Expert Committee and Central Level Expert Committee. The State Level Expert Committee (SLEC) is proposed to interact with farmers of the State through Video Conferencing on quarterly basis. It is proposed to collect, collate and prioritize farmers queries related to agriculture and all allied sectors across complete value chain i.e. from production to marketing, including other critical areas such as soil health, water use efficiency,waste/residue management etc. from all Blocks/Districts of a State using ATMA network. All important District Level queries are proposed to be documented at the level of State Nodal Cell (SNC). SNC is responsible to coordinate and implement interaction between farmers and scientists on regular basis through video conferencing. The cost norms for this activity are given at A.9 of the cafeteria. The mechanism for Video Conferencing would be as under:-  a) Interaction of 20-25 farmers per district with State Level Expert Committee (SLEC) at NIC District Centres. b) Such Video Conference may be organized on quarterly basis. a) Farmers queries to be sourced from ATM/BTM at Blocks to PD/ATMA at District to State Nodal Cell(SNC). b) SNCs to scrutinize the farmers queries and prepare reply through experts. c) Live interaction of experts with farmers on designated day through Video Conference. d) Webcasting of VC for larger dissemination Suggestive composition of State Level Expert Committee (SLSC) would be as under:- SN Designation Status 1. Agriculture Production Commissioner/ Prin. Chairman Secretary (Agri.) /Secretary (Agri.) 2. Director of Agriculture Vice-Chairman 3. Director of Horticulture Member 4. Director of Animal Husbandry Member 5. Director of State Marketing Board Member 6. Director of Sericulture/Fishery/Veterinary etc. Member 7. Directors (ICAR Institutes located in the State) Member 8.

Director, Directorates of GOI located in the State Member 12. Regional Director of IMD Member 13. Director (SAMETI) / Addl. Director Agri (Extn.) Member Secretary 4.3 Cost Norms under Cafeteria and activity ceiling: (i) The mandatory activities indicated in the Cafeteria should invariably form a part of the State Extension Work Plan. Administrative Expenditure including TA/DA, hiring of vehicles and POL and operational expenses at District/Block level shall not exceed the amount provided for in the cafeteria. Financial allocation has been made specifically for the conduct of BFAC, DFAC, and joint visits of Scientists & Extension Functionaries under the cafeteria. The States should compute their budgetary requirements for mandatory activities, cafeteria activities as per States priorities, manpower support and emoluments as per approved norms. Any savings in administrative expenses can be diverted to other categories but not vice versa.  (ii) The norms as laid down in these Guidelines have to be adhered to but in exceptional cases and for reasons to be recorded in writing, ATMA Governing Board (GB) may go beyond these ceilings by up to 10% without exceeding overall allocation. Similarly, IDWG can authorize relaxation of up to 15%. All such cases shall have to be reported in next years Work Plan so that appropriate advisories can be issued. Any deviation of more than 15% from the prescribed norms/ceilings or any activity not specified in the guidelines can be taken up by States only with the prior approval of DA&FW.  V.Convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension  V. Convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension 5. With a view to improve farm income and livelihood security of the farming households, the Government has been implementing number of programmes under various Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored schemes through the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. This can be facilitated to a great extent through a demand driven technology development and its transfer to farmers in an effective way with a focus on ensuring convergence of efforts at different levels for rendering an integrated service delivery to the farmers. In particular, the linkages between National Agriculture Research System (NARS) and extension machinery at cutting edge level need to be strengthened. 5.1 While the concept of district level Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) has been promoted with an idea to provide a platform for integrated extension delivery involving all the stakeholders, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) operating at the same level act as an outreach arm of National Agricultural Research System (NARS) facilitating validation and adoption of new technologies through frontline demonstrations, training & awareness programmes and other initiatives. 5.2 A detailed circular on research-extension convergence was last issued on 17th June, 2015 under joint signatures of Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare and Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research & Education & DG, ICAR indicating agreed and actionable points for both extension system in the State (represented by ATMA) and the NARS (represented by the State Agricultural Universities, ICAR Research Institutes and KVKs at the cutting edge level. There has been varying levels of progress in implementation of these guidelines across the States. The situation has been reviewed in light of operational concerns expressed by different stakeholders in implementation of these guidelines and recent developments at policy and operational front which require reiterating salient points of the earlier circular apart from new initiatives. 5.3 In order to ensure that the technology development for grass root level is demand driven and captures the critical gaps existing at technology and extension front, the farmers are able to gain desired benefits out of these interventions .The action points which have been agreed between the two departments are elaborated in the following paras :- 5.4 All the steps as laid down in the revised ATMA Guidelines to ensure better convergence between research and extension will be considered to utilize the built- in provisions under the ATMA Cafeteria. i. Farmer Scientist Interactions (FSI) at District level: Farmer Scientist interactions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers concerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help in bringing forth various technological options for the coming season  which is suited to the local situations. ATMA Cafeteria provides for Farmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2 days @Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 2 such interactions, one before each crop season per year may be organized in each district with active involvement of local KVK and SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the district. ii. The SAU may designate an expert who would be in-charge of one District to provide instant guidance to extension functionaries in the District. He/she will work in tandem with District Head of Agriculture and Allied Departments, Project Director ATMA and Programme Coordinator, KVK. A fixed amount of Rs.3000/- per month per district has been provided to meet expert honorarium of these officials related to returning calls of the farmers and other stakeholders that they may receive. IDWG may decide on break-up of the amount among four such officers as above in every district after considering mobile phone expenses already being reimbursed by the State Government and other organisations concerned and actual comparative necessity. iii. Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Joint visits by the PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level KVK/SAU/ICAR scientists greatly helps in creating a common understanding of field level technological issues and providing an integrated solution to the problems faced by the farmers. In order to ensure proper mobility for field visits of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provided under ATMA cafeteria for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/-per visit per district. iv. Organization of Kisan Goshthies: To strengthen Research  Extension  Farmer linkages 1 Kisan Goshthi per block in each of the 2 seasons is envisaged in the ATMA cafeteria. KVK and SAU Scientists may plan the same with PD, ATMA and actively participate in the said event. Cost norm revised to Rs. 25000 per programme. v. Assessment, Refinement, Validation & adoption of Frontline technologies and other short-term researchable issues: ATMA cafeteria provided Rs.7.00 lakh per district for undertaking research or refinement and validation of technologies arising out of the Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) or any of those which are to be undertaken through KVKs and other local Research Centres. vi. ATMA Management Committee having Programme Coordinator, KVK as its member may review the progress of technology application - related activities funded by ATMA. Besides this, the KVK may also provide an Agricultural Technology Update (ATU) on half-yearly basis  i.e. before the start of Kharif and Rabi crop seasons to the ATMA for its wider dissemination among the farmers of the district. vii. Interface meeting: Programme Coordinators of the KVKs in the District besides participating in the ATMA Governing Board should also have an interface meeting with the Project Director, ATMA once a month during the cropping season and work out a strategy of providing crop advisories to farmers for various stages of crop growth. Scientists available in the KVKs will advise and mentor Block Technology Teams in identifying technological needs in various Blocks in the District and programmatic interventions to meet such needs. viii. Conduct of Field Days, Kisan Melas and Goshthies: ATMA and KVK should coordinate with each other in the conduct of Field Days, Kisan Melas, Goshthies and setting up of Farm Schools, so that there is no duplication in coverage and they should ensure percolation of appropriate scientific practices down to the field level. ix. Release of Fund to KVKs: Funds for KVK activities under ATMA programme will be released directly to KVKs under intimation to respective controlling authorities i.e. Director Extension Education (DEE) & Comptroller and Directors of ICAR Institute in case of KVKs run by Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutes respectively. For the KVKs run by NGOs, funds will be released directly to KVKs under intimation to Zonal Project Directors of the zone concerned. Utilisation Certificates for the funds released by ATMA will be provided by the KVKs only. However, the respective host organisations and monitoring authorities (i.e. Agricultural Universities, ICAR institutes and Zonal Project Directors) will continue to supervise all activities of KVKs including the ones related to ATMA. x. Documentation of Researchable Issues: The long term researchable issues may be documented, agro-climatic zone-wise with the involvement of Zonal Agricultural Research Stations (ZARS). These issues will be formally communicated to the concerned ZARS through the respective SAUs with the approval of the Inter- Departmental Working Group (IDWG). The IDWG having Vice- Chancellor/s of SAUs as well as Director(s) of ICAR institutes in the State as its members will review the progress of research work taken up by the ZARSs on such issues. xi. Implementation of Flagship Programmes: KVKs will provide advice to ATMA and the District Administration for the implementation of Flagship programmes of the DA&FW covered under RKVY and Krishonnati Yojana. The KVK Scientists will technically advise the Block Technology Teams (BTTs) and will also be actively involved in  preparation of Block Action Plans (BAPs), especially with regard to research related issues/gaps and strategies. Regular participation of a KVK scientist in the meetings of Block Technology Teams will be ensured at least once in a quarter. The participating scientist will also take feedback for his colleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective areas of expertise. xii. Involvement of SAUs/KVKs in Training and capacity building of Extension Functionaries under ATMA and Kisan Call Centres: The SAUs and KVKs act as a repository of technologies in agriculture and allied sector suited to specific local situations. Their active involvement in organizing orientation and refresher training programmes for these functionaries would greatly help them updating their technological knowledge for a better extension delivery. xiii. Data Entry of Demonstrations by KVKs and SAUs: Data on demonstrations being organised by district ATMAs for agriculture and allied sectors (including diversification from one sector to another) is being entered in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS) (https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). The details of the same can be fetched from ERMS as well as from the Farmers Portal clicking at the link provided therein. However, some very useful and effective demonstrations carried out by SAUs / KVKs etc. have not been entered and thus not made part of the drillable database at the link given in the Farmers Portal. State Agricultural Universities (including Horticultural, Veterinary and Fisheries), Zonal Project Directors and KVKs to start doing data entry on the ERMS interface, so that farmers can know about the demonstrations of their interest that are taking place in their area and a scientific analysis of efficacy of various agricultural practices, new technologies, varieties of seeds/species etc. can be carried out. xiv. Use of mKisan Portal for Sending Text and Voice Based Advisories to Farmers: The mKisan Portal launched by the DA&FW provides a very useful interface for sending text and voice based advisories to Farmers. Scientist working in ICAR Headquarters, Zonal Project Directors, Research Institutes, & AICRPs, SAUS and KVKs may register as users in the portal and keep sending useful and need based advisories to targeted farmers using the mKisan interface. Feedback may be taken from farmers during Field Visits about usefulness of advisories. xv. Involvement of Scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs in providing Technical Backstopping to the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs): The scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs may be nominated to act as Call Conferencing experts with the Kisan Call Centres  operating in respective States to answer the query of farmers which the Farm Tele Advisors (FTAs) at the KCCs are not able to answer. The Heads of Concerned Institutions may send a Roster of nominated experts at Monthly/Fortnightly intervals to the KCCs designated for the concerned States available on the link http://mkisan.gov.in/kccstatesinvolvement.aspx. Similarly the Scientists from SAUs and SMSs in the KVKs may also be mapped in the Call Escalation Matrix of the Kisan Call Centres to provide their comments to State/District level officers of Agriculture and allied sector on the farmers queries escalated to them through KKMS as detailed at the link http://mkisan.gov.in/kccescalationmatrix.aspx. 5.5 Additional requirement of TA/DA, etc. will be met by the respective Departments from their own budgetary allocations. However, funds available under ATMA Cafeteria for Research-Extension-Farmer linkages may also be appropriately utilized. 5.6 Senior officials from DA&FW and DARE/ICAR would be visiting the States from time to time to review the progress in getting better coordination and interface between the scientific community and the State agriculture machinery on the one hand and the farmers on the other. 5.7 State Governments shall give wide publicity to this arrangement and furnish report on regular basis on the convergence matrix in prescribed format given at Annexure-II of ATMA Guidelines, 2025.  VI. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER SCHEMES  6. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION WORK WITH OTHER SCHEMES 6.1.1. Farmers skill trainings and field extension as contained in other schemes of DA&FW may be converged with similar farmer-related activities going on through ATMA. Thus, for instance, Seed Village programmes under SMSP, capacity building of farmers through institutions identified by the State Government under SMAM and pest monitoring, Farmer Field Schools & Integrated Pest Management (IPM) trainings to farmers under SMPP will only be carried out through the district level institutions of ATMA and Block Technology Teams. Mutually synergetic linkages will be established among various activities instead of unilaterally mandating that all such farmer-centric activities shall be carried out through ATMA. For instance, half days training given under Seed Village Programme shall also be made part of Farm Schools as, in any case, training on seed technologies form a part of 6 critical stages during which farmers are trained under Farm Schools conducted under ATMA. This convergence should be institutionalized by ensuring that State Extension Work Plan [which emanates from Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP)] covers field level training & extension components. SREP is an ideal platform to provide convergence from the conceptual level and prioritization point of view. IDWG will further underline such a convergent approach at the State level. 6.1.2 A single ATMA Governing Board headed by the District Magistrate will provide commonality in approach & implementation and avoid duplication. ATMA Governing Board shall act as an over-arching umbrella at District level to oversee all extension related activities in other schemes of Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM- RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY). Such a holistic approach will avoid duplication of efforts and promote more extensive & inclusive coverage of beneficiaries. The Integrated ICT platforms (such as Farmers Portal, State Agriculture Portals, Central Agriculture Portal) will also provide requisite impetus to implementation in the field level. 6.1.3.Convergence with other Farmer Centric Schemes of DA&FW: With the given man-power support, ATMAs will also look after the work related to other schemes of Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY). There should be full convergence of extension related work being carried out under different programmes/schemes. The field level extension workers under these different programmes/schemes should work in conjunction with the dedicated manpower being provided under this Scheme under the umbrella of BTT or ATMA, as the case may be.  While these extension related workers & consultants under other schemes/programmes can continue to act as experts in their respective fields, they should also double up as multifunctional extension workers in the jurisdiction to be assigned to them by the BTT/ATMA. Budget for extension related components in different schemes and programmes of DA&FW shall be dovetailed at district level through ATMA. Once all the extension related workers start working in unison, they shall be fully responsible for achieving convergence & synergy in extension related work under PM-RKVY and KY Schemes to achieve complementarities and check duplication of efforts and resources. 6.1.4. Convergence with Research System: ATMA scheme provides for active involvement of Research System/ Research Agencies at different levels of implementation. State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have to be fully involved not only in preparation of SREP and Extension Work Plans but also in implementation of various programmes in the field. They will be represented in all bodies, namely, ATMA GB and ATMA MC in districts, SLSC/ IDWGs at State level, BTT - BFAC Meetings at Block level. In addition, each KVK scientist may be made in charge of one or more Blocks within the district. The KVK Scientist will technically advise the BTT and will also be actively involved in preparation of BAPs, especially with regard to research related issues/gaps and strategies. He will also take feedback from his colleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective areas of expertise. A joint circular on convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension signed by the Secretary (DARE) & DG, ICAR and the Secretary (A&C) was issued to all concerned on 17th June, 2015. 6.1.5 Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Quite often it has been seen that scientists of the Universities and ICAR Institutions refrain from making field visits due to inadequate provision of mobility in their budget. In order to ensure proper mobility of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provisioned for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL expenses for field visits of scientists along with extension functionaries. It is expected that at-least 5 pre- identified villages would be covered in a month under the visit. 6.1.6 Convergence with Development Departments: Necessary convergence with all line departments is to be ensured through their involvement in the process of preparation of SREP and Work Plans at Block, District & State levels. Work Plans to be submitted to  SLSC for approval should specify the activities which are to be supported out of resources from other schemes and activities which are to be funded under ATMA Scheme. Necessary convergence is to be ensured through integration of Comprehensive District Action Plans (CDAPs) and District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs)  all of which will form an integral part of Annual Action Plan(AAP) to be approved by State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) under Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY).). Further, within approved allocations of Scheme, the State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) may also approve inter component changes as per need during the course of implementation of the Work Plan, within ambit of Guidelines, which should be reported to DA&FW immediately. Active involvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the selection of beneficiaries for various farmer oriented activities, including selection of Farmer Friend should be ensured. 6.1.7 Convergence with & Involvement of Non-Governmental Sector: (a) In order to ensure promotion of multi-agency extension strategies, and to implement scheme activities in Service Provider mode, at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at district level is to be incurred through Non-Governmental Sector viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para- Extension Workers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will be eligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities (but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity. Outsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the organization concerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower deployed under ATMA is unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious tasks. Agri-preneurs under ACABC can also be covered for this 10% service charge and 100% cost of activity after they clear their loan liability though they can be called as experts on honorarium anytime for any training organized otherwise. These organizations are free to voluntarily contribute to the cost of training or fully/partially bear the service charges. Exclusion of any Agri-preneurs or Para-extension workers from this category which are considered big enough can be done at the discretion of the State Governments concerned. These agencies will be identified at the district level on the basis of merit  and approval of ATMA (GB) will be obtained. Competitive and transparent bidding process for this as per extent rules and regulations and financial norms. Expenditure incurred by the State Government for extension work (viz. service provider mode) shall count towards the threshold figure of 10% as stipulated in sub-para (a) above. 6.2. NETWORKING: State level bodies/ officers viz. State Nodal Officer/ State Coordinator/ Gender Coordinator will ensure networking of all ATMAs so as to foster information sharing (success stories, best practices, research/ extension issues, application of innovative technologies & strategies, etc.). All States/Districts shall share information regarding their activities/ innovations/ successes to the outside world on the national ATMA portal (www.extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). Also progress of the scheme activities shall be reported on the national ATMA portal. This Portal shall also have links to related websites both at State and National level.  VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION  7. MONITORING & EVALUATION (M&E)/Monitoring Framework: 7.1 In order to ensure quality of extension activities, following monitoring framework is provided in the revised guidelines at different levels: i. At Block Level: Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) and Block Technology Team (BTT) constituted under the Scheme will monitor Block level ATMA activities on quarterly basis by conducting a meeting of farmers along- with elected representatives of panchayat. Farmer Friend / ATM will coordinate and facilitate these meetings. Feedback of the meeting will be shared with the district-level agency for suitably incorporating in the future planning for improving effectiveness of the Scheme. Block Action Plan (BAP) will be prepared at block level in consultation with BFAC & BTT. ii. At District Level: ATMA Governing Board headed by DM or CDO or CEO as decided by DM will review and monitor District level ATMA activities in every quarter and decide integration and re-designing of on-going developmental schemes in accordance with the Strategic Research and Extension Plans (SREP) of the District. The Governing Board will provide policy directions that support effective functioning of ATMA in the district and amend the rules and bye-laws for the agency. ATMA management committee and District Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC) will provide input for developing District Annual Agriculture Plan (DAAP) incorporating BAPs of all the blocks in the district. PD, ATMA of the district will coordinate and facilitate convening of the meetings of ATMA, GB / ATMA, MC / DFAC at prescribed intervals. iii. At State Level: State Nodal Cell (ATMA) compile District Annual Agriculture Plan (DAAP) of all the districts at the state level in the form of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) and place it before the Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) in the meeting for consideration and approval before sending AAP to the SLSC constituted under the Chairperson-ship of the Chief Secretary of the State for approval of AAP of both PM-RKVY and KY Schemes. The IDWG  under the chairperson-ship of APC/Pr. Secretary (Agriculture), may continue with the day to day (in its quarterly meetings) monitoring to ensure that the extension reforms are executed in line with the provisions contained in ATMA Guidelines. There is an in built provision in the Cafeteria of ATMA Activities to carry out concurrent evaluation for regular improvement in the quality of the schematic activities. It deals with things such as when the programme activities occur, where they occur, and who delivers them. Thus, it involves the evaluation of all the activities under taken to achieve programme objectives. The feedback generated through this evaluation can be used for improving implementation of the programme by focusing on mid-season / term correction. The concurrent evaluation is to be undertaken every year during the course of implementation of the schematic activities. The purpose is to conduct a broad based SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis so that mid-course correction is initiated at the appropriate point of time. State Nodal Officer (ATMA) will coordinate and facilitate to convene the meetings of IDWG and SLSC at the prescribed periodic intervals. iv. At National Level: Progress of extension work done by ATMAs through different extension activities shall also be monitored at national level on quarterly basis under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary (Extension). Joint Director (Extension Reforms) will initiate proposal to convene the National Level Review Meetings of ATMA activities on quarterly basis. A web-based interface (https://extensionreforms.da.gov.in) has been provided for regular monitoring of the progress of extension activities. Individual data of farmers under training, exposure visits and demonstrations needs to be entered in the web-based interface using the ICT infrastructure already available in the states. Nodal Officers (State-Wise) will be identified at national level for field monitoring of ATMA activities. Extensive touring of the officers of the DA&FW / Directorate of Extension / MANAGE Faculty will be carried out for on the spot monitoring of the field activities being undertaken under the scheme.  7.2 Cumulative Monthly Progress Reports (MPRs) for each district are to be uploaded by the Project Director, ATMA in a web-based interface available at https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.inby day 5 of the following month. After ensuring that all the districts have entered their data, the SNO will validate this data for the entire State by day 10 of the following month. Submission of manual/ physical reports may be gradually phased out. The progress shall be given online on ERMS portal as digitized data is essentially required for monitoring progress on DBT portal. Effective M&E will be ensured through regular field visits of Inter Disciplinary Teams in project areas, reports, interfaces, conferences etc. The scheme also provides for Concurrent Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) which will be carried out by Government of India. DA&FW will also organize concurrent M&E including impact evaluation as needed as part of its scheme Extension Support to Central Institutes/DOE. Besides, all activities of the scheme would continue to be reviewed on quarterly basis in meetings held at National Level. 7.3 For effective and efficient management of ATMA Scheme, the MoAFW will reply on the data sharing mechanism of Agri Stack, Agri Stack is a Digital public infrastructure which captures and maintains farmer registry, crops sown registry, and geo-referenced village maps. The relevant data pertinent to implementation of schemes will be consumed electronically (using open APIs) for the purposes of beneficiary identification, verification, benefit delivery and monitoring -pertaining to the states, Districts, villages where the data is available. The information as and when collected and collated in the Farmers registry, digital crop surveys, and geo- referenced village maps will be used for implementation of this scheme. Field on which data will be available in AgriStack is given at Annexure. 7.4 Progress of extension work done by ATMs at Block Level, Farm Schools, Demonstration Plots, Trainings, Exposure Visits and Farmer Friends will be closely monitored using ICT infrastructure and by regular monitoring & meetings by BTT at block level, ATMA at district level and SLSC at State level. A web-based interface (https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in) has been provided for the purpose. Individual-wise data of farmers under trainings and exposure visits needs to be entered in the web based interface above using the ICT infrastructure already available there in the states. Till the time hand-held devices are made available as a part of ITD Interventions, BTMs and ATMs should be encouraged to use their Smart Phones using software to be provided to upload pictures of trainings. Suitable incentive not exceeding Rs.50/- per training may be provided for uploading the pictures of such trainings.  7.5 Impact Assessment Studies of extension work done by Farm Schools, CIGs & FFs under ATMA shall be got conducted by expert agencies and corrective action shall be taken timely to attain objectives of revitalization of Agriculture Extension System. 7.6 Extensive touring of officers of the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation& Farmers Welfare/Directorate of Extension, MANAGE faculty, State/District level officials will be carried out for the on-spot monitoring of field activities being undertaken. 7.7 Concurrent Evaluation : It is concerned with how the program is delivered. It deals with things such as when the program activities occur, where they occur, and who delivers them. Thus, it involves the evaluation of all the activities undertaken to achieve programme objectives. The information generated through this evaluation can be used for improving implementation of the programme by focusing on mid-season/term correction. It is also referred as formative or process evaluation. Yearly concurrent/process evaluation of all activities to be undertaken to achieve programme objectives. The concurrent evaluation is to be taken up every year during the course of implementation of the programme. The purpose is to conduct a broad based SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis so that mid-course correction is initiated at the appropriate point of time. The funds may be utilized for engaging personnel for data collection, compilation, analysis, data processing, evaluation, etc. on task basis.  VIII. BUDGET ALLOCATION, RELEASE & UTILISATION  8. ALLOCATIONS AND SCHEME COST 8.1 CentreState Share : The funding support for the Scheme shall be in the ratio of 60:40 (Centre : State) between Central and State Governments and on 90:10 basis (Centre : State)between central and North-Eastern and Himalayan States for all components including Farmer Friend. 100% GOI funding support to be provided to UTs for all components. 8.2 State-wise Allocation Criteria : Some States have very small districts whereas some other States have very large districts but the size of the Block does not vary much from State to State. Therefore, funds available under the scheme shall be initially allocated to States after giving weightage to the number of Blocks, number of farm families in the State and number of dedicated deployed manpower. Actual release of resources to States shall, however, be on the basis of approved work plans, pace of utilization of funds and physical progress. 8.3 Incentive to States for Better Performance : The States may prepare a large shelf of projects/activities and submit them to the Department at beginning of financial year. Better performing States will be encouraged to seek higher revised allocations against approved activities in respect of Work Plans submitted by them. Such allocations over and above tentative allocation already communicated to States will depend upon relative progress in implementation and pace of expenditure amongst various States and over all availability of funds. However, it is clarified that the expenditure during the year will be restricted by States to funds actually placed at their disposal by the DA&FW and States should not incur expenditure in excess of funds already available with the States. Any proposal to the DA&FW in the following financial year for reimbursement of excess expenditure will not be entertained. Thus, State may not create any liability. 8.4. RELEASE OF FUNDS : 8.4.1 Funds will be released for implementing the Scheme, in four equal installments. State Governments to comply all the instructions of Department of Expenditure O.M dated 23.03.2021 and 23.03.2022. 75% of annual allocation(3 equal installments) will be released upon approved SEWP by SLSC/in-principle approval of SEWP by the Chairman of SLSC and Provisional Utilization Certificate (PUC) & Annual Progress Report (APR) of previous financial year. Additional 25% of allocation(4th installment) will be released upon approved SEWP by SLSC, AUC & APR of the previous year and latest MPR showing at least 75% utilization of earlier release (central + state share). The State will be  required to submit a written request for release of funds. Revised procedure for release of CSS funds to States i.e. SNA-Sparsh will be applicable as per instructions of Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. Release of fourth instalment will depend upon furnishing of the following documents: (i) Approved/ratified SEWP by SLSC. (ii) Audited Utilization Certificate (AUC) & Audited Statement of Expenditure (ASoE) for the previous year. (iii) Monthly Progress Report for previous month (iv) Annual progress report for the previous year (v) Transfer of the stipulated States share to the Single Nodal Account (SNA) against funds provided by Central Government upto the previous year. (vi) Consolidated proposal for release of funds to be submitted to KY Cell through Nodal Officer designated by the State Government. 8.5 Manual reports may be phased out gradually 8.5.1 The State Government will transfer the Central share received in its account to the SNAs account concerned within a period of 21 days of its receipts. The Central share shall not be diverted to the personal deposit account or any other account by the State Government. Corresponding State share should be released as early as possible and not later than 30 days of release of the Central share. 8.5.2 State Governments will follow the revised procedure for release of CSS funds /Just -in- time release using SNA-SPARSH Platform as per the instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance time to time. 8.5.3 The States need to follow a definite time frame for fund releases from State level to District level (within a fortnight of receipt of funds from DA&FW) and from Districts to line departments/other agencies (within 10 days of receipt of money at district level) to ensure expeditious implementation of the Scheme.  IX. OTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS  OTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS 9.1 Extent of Coverage: The Scheme shall be implemented in all districts across the country. 9.2 Incentives for difficult areas : In order to carry out extension activities in difficult areas, an additional 10% allocation may be made by the states in the difficult areas viz: Left Wing Affected Districts, North Eastern & Hilly States, Aspirational Districts and Double Stressed Districts. 9.3 Individual beneficiary oriented activities: i. The Cafeteria of Activities contains some individual beneficiary oriented components as well. Some of such activities include farmers training, demonstrations, farm schools, farmer-scientist interactions & exposure visits which have been culled out from the cafeteria and summarized in Annexure XI. ii. Transparent and objective selection of beneficiaries is of paramount importance not only to generate confidence of the farmers in the Scheme but also to ensure that benefits of extension services get disseminated to all sections of the Society. Therefore, selection of beneficiaries should be done in the following manner: a) All Panchayats in a Block should be covered on a rotation basis under various components. The Panchayats to be covered in a year should be decided by the BTT in consultation with the BFAC. b) Activity mapping of Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) is at ANNEXURE-X. c) Number of beneficiaries of different categories including SC/ST in shortlisted Panchayats will be decided by the BTT in proportion to their population in consultation with BFAC so as to have a balanced coverage. d) At least 50% beneficiaries must be Small and Marginal Farmers and 30% beneficiaries should be women farmers/farm women. e) Individual beneficiaries of demonstration plots, inter-district & inter-state trainings within a Panchayat area and all farmer group beneficiaries should be selected by the respective Gram Sabha or Gram Panchayats in consultation with FIGs and FOs working in the area, as the State Government may decide. However, if for some reasons, the list of beneficiaries is not finalized in the above manner within the stipulated time frame, the FAC in consultation with FIGs and FOs may select the beneficiaries for various activities under the scheme.  If the list of beneficiaries is not finalized in time, the BFAC in consultation with FIGs &FOs may select the beneficiaries f) For rewards and incentives at different levels, beneficiaries may be identified by the States in a transparent manner. It should be ensured that no farmer gets double benefits of the same kind from different schemes. g) ATMAs should capture Unique Identification (UID) details of the farmer beneficiaries under the components of availing training, exposure visits, demonstration plots, farm schools, revolving fund for the CIGs etc. and upload the details in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS) Portal developed by the Department. 9.4 Common Issues related to ATMA Cafeteria: i. Minimum 30% of resources meant for programmes and activities are required to be allocated to women farmers and women extension functionaries. Specific documentation of expenditure and performance for women may be kept. ii. No expenditure shall be incurred from extension work plan allocation on ineligible items. In the event of any such expenditure, the ineligible expenses shall be deducted from the States allocation, next year. iii. Operational Expenses under State Level, District & Block level Activities and Innovative Activities may also include library, internet, telephone and other contingencies. iv. Any sub-detailing not specified under ATMA Cafeteria such as for Demonstrations, Trainings and Exposure Visits, would be as approved under an appropriate scheme of the Central/State Govt. Otherwise, prior approval would have to be obtained from IDWG. v. Unless otherwise specified under some compelling circumstances, or in case of States which are not eligible for PM-RKVY funding, the SLSC set up in the State for considering proposals for PM-RKVY funding will also consider and approve SEWP and carry out periodic monitoring. In exceptional cases, the  existing procedure for approval of SEWP through IDWG at the State level and Executive Committee of SMAE will continue to be followed. The IDWG under the chairmanship of APC/PS (Agriculture) may continue to perform monitoring of the Scheme to ensure that the Extension Reforms are executed as per these Guidelines. The IDWG shall meet at least once in every quarter. vi. Programmatic funds should be spent on rain-fed areas at least in proportion to the extent of rain-fed areas in the district. 9.5 Promotion of Multi-Agency Extension Strategy : (i) In order to ensure promotion of multi-agency extension strategies, and to implement scheme activities in Service Provider mode, at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at district level is to be incurred through Non- Governmental Sector viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. Since a lot of manpower and infrastructure has been given under the Scheme for providing extension services, the State Government should fix an upper limit on extension services in Service Provider mode. This percentage limit should be clearly spelt out in the SEWP. (ii) Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para-Extension Workers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will be eligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities (but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity. Outsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the organisation concerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower deployed under ATMA is unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious tasks. Agri-preneurs under ACABC can also be covered for this 10% service charge and 100% cost of activity after they clear their loan liability though they can be called as experts on honorarium anytime for any training organized otherwise. These organizations are free to voluntarily contribute to the cost of training or fully/partially bear the service charges.

(iii) These would be set up in the field of outstanding or achiever farmers. The list of such farmers having potential for organizing farm schools in the Block for different sectors will be identified jointly by FAC and BTT and sent to ATMA GB through the Panchayat Samiti (block level elected body of Panchayati Raj Institutions). Farm Schools and Farm School Trainers for each season will finally be approved by the ATMA GB. (iv) Teachers in the Farm Schools could be progressive farmers, extension functionaries or experts belonging to Government or Non-Government Sector. (v) One of the main activities of Farm Schools would be to operationalize Front Line Demonstrations in one or more crops and/or allied sector activities. These demonstrations would focus on Integrated Crop Management including field preparation, seed treatment, IPM, INM, etc. (vi) Farm Schools would provide season long technical backstopping/training to target farmers by having an interactive session once at least during each of the 6 critical stages in a cropping season. (vii) While selecting the trainee farmers, about 50% representation should be given to small and marginal farmers. Preference may be given to members of CIGs/FIGs. (viii) Students will visit Farm Schools as per specified schedule or as may be necessary. Teachers may also visit students as may be necessary. (ix) Knowledge and skills of teachers would be upgraded on a continuous basis through training at district/ state/ national level institutions and/or exposure visits, etc. (x) In addition to technical support through Farm Schools, knowledge and skill of students may also be upgraded through training at District/State level and exposure visits, etc. Students would have the responsibility of providing extension support to other farmers in the respective village or neighbouring villages. (xi) Maximum Service Charge to achiever farmer may be 10% of the total cost incurred on item No.1-5 of Farm School cost norm given at (Appendix-II). 93 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA (xii) Achiever Farmer, while conducting the Farm School, can take the technical support from KVK scientists and extension personnel to explain the scientific rationale behind a particular practice. (xiii) Either Training or Exposure Visit of about 5 to 6 days of the Progressive/ Achiever Farmer is supported under the Farm School as per norms approved in the Cafeteria. (xiv) Trainees would bear their own travel expenses. BTM should act as coordinator for Farm Schools with periodic monitoring of the activities done at his level (at least 1 visit at every critical crop stages) to oversee and monitor the functioning & maintain record of visits. He may arrange an Interface between the achiever farmers (taking up Farm School) and the BTT & KVK scientists at least on quarterly basis to exchange ideas at district level. (xv) Performance of all farm schools in each block should be reviewed at BTT-FAC meetings on a half-yearly basis and by ATMA GBs on an annual basis. (xvi) For the reasons to be recorded in writing, highly successful Farm Schools may be continued for another season or two, with provision of only recurring expenses during subsequent years/seasons. When continued in subsequent seasons, the participants should be selected from villages/panchayats not covered in the earlier Farm Schools. (xvii) States may consider suitably awarding the best Farm school in the district/state. (xviii) Trainings in Farm School should be flexible and non-lecture based with emphasis on hands-on-experience, observation, analysis and discussions. (xix) Farm School concept (nature, periodicity & training) needs to be revisited and improved by taking various innovative steps such as involving non- academic experts also from farming and business community and also including Indigenous Technical Knowledge. New training aids like Pico Projectors can be used. 94 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA OPERATIONALIZING FARM SCHOOL AT BLOCK / GRAM PANCHAYAT LEVEL COST NORMS/ CEILINGS S.No. Farm School (Block /GP Level) Present Proposed cost - norms of FS (in Rs.) cost - norms of Model- 1 in the field Model- 2- in the FS of Progressive field of Awardee (in Rs.)

Background: Agriculture represent significant and skilled sector in which majority of the cultivation task need higher skills that include land preparation, seed treatment, sowing, fertilizer application, pest management, farm mechanization, irrigation, harvesting, storage, marketing etc. Several cultivation tasks involve intellectual understanding of the package of practices, tools & techniques and process to execute farming practices. As a matter of fact, farmers are performing field operations from production to marketing of farm produce and skilfully undertaken such activities by virtue of their traditional & scientific knowledge and farming experience. It has often been felt that most of the Indian farmers have only access to traditional knowledge and in most cases there is huge gap in existing knowledge and new skill sets required in modernizing agriculture. Besides, farmers need to be empowered with latest farming technologies like irrigation systems, mechanization, high yielding varieties, INM and IPM. However application of technology requires up-gradation of knowledge through training and advisory services. This shall be achieved through short-term bridge courses in the priority areas of agriculture and allied sector, which will act as enabler for up- skilling and empowering the farmers. 2. Vision: To recognize the prior learning and up-skilling of 1.25 crore farmers in next five years for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26. 3. Objective:  To assess the competence of farmers in the structured framework through RPL and up-skilling them to adopt improved farm practices. 4. Implementation Strategy for RPL:  ATMA being the Project Implementing Agency at District level to coordinate with KVKs, SAUs, agriculture & allied Departments, District Training Centres and other local bodies to implementing Guidelines for the same will be issued to States to conduct 2 days RPL based bridge training for capacity building of farmers in agriculture and allied areas.  All farmers including women farmers imparted training under Extension Reforms(ATMA) to undergo five step RPL process (i) Mobilization, (ii) Counselling & pre-screening, (iii) Orientation, (iv) Assessment & (v) Certification. 107 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA  Each enrolled candidate to undergo following RPL process: Activity Duration  Domain Training (clarifying any doubts/ gaps a 3-4 hours candidate may have with respect to existing farming practices and identifying gaps in adoption of good agricultural practices.  Soft Skills in domain areas.  Familiarization with Assessment Process  The RPL based bridge trainings are to be conducted by ATMA block level functionaries in coordination with KVKs/SAUs & others stakeholders.  The provision under RPL would be included in the guidelines of Extension Reforms (ATMA) scheme and the cost norms of ATMA cafeteria for training of farmers shall be applicable for RPL based bridge training.  Assessment of candidates for RPL and certification may be done through designated agency (NGOs/Pvt. organization etc) identified by ATMA.  These training are to be coordinated at village level to facilitate their training within the location of village itself.  Bridge course option in specific areas of maximum 12 hours duration for certification as per list of priority areas. Bridge course may be for any duration but not beyond 12 hours (total maximum period of RPL based bridge training can be 4 + 12 hours  16 hours).  Assessment has to be conducted in local language. Special arrangements may be made for assessment and training of candidates who cannot read and write.  Training Need Assessment/ Training Schedule High quality pictures & videos, training attendance record/ sheets & other documents required for RPL/Skill certification may be captured.  Any non-compliance to RPL process during mobilization, screening, training, assessment & certification would be placed before the Coordination Committee/Assessment Committee for appropriate action. 5. Course Curriculum for RPL and Bridge Training of Farmers: Day-1:  Capture information of beneficiary farmer for RPL and identify the skill gaps through structured questionnaire.  Orientation on user friendly mobile software.  Focused training of farmers on identified gaps with reference to location specific farming technologies.  Training of farmers in specialized areas in agriculture and allied sectors. 108 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA Day-2:  Training of farmers in specialized areas in agriculture and allied sectors.

Background & Strategy  Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) 1. Background and Strategy: 1.1 SMAE: Erstwhile Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) was being implemented under National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) w.e.f. 2014-15 which has been subsumed as a sub-scheme of Umbrella Scheme Krishonnati Yojana from the financial year 2017-18. Restructuring and strengthening of agricultural extension machinery has to be a judicious mix of extensive physical outreach of personnel, enhancement in quality through domain experts & regular capacity building, interactive methods of information dissemination, pervasive & innovative use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) / Mass Media, Federation of groups and convergence of extension related efforts under various schemes and programmes of Government of India and the State Governments. The objective of this Sub-Mission is to appropriately strengthen, expand and up-scale existing Extension Schemes. The on-going Extension Schemes include the Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes being implemented by the Extension Division/Directorate of Extension. Even in the case of Central Sector Schemes which are proposed to be subsumed within the Sub- Mission, a greater role has been envisaged for the States through their active involvement in planning, implementation and monitoring. The continuation of SMAE beyond 12th Plan period includes the following components:- A. Centrally Sponsored Scheme Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms(ATMA) Scheme. B. Central Sector Schemes (i). Agri-Clinics & Agri-Business Centre (AC&ABC); (ii) Kisan Call Centre (KCC); (iii) Mass Media Scheme in Agricultural Extension (MMSAE) including strengthening of Digital Agriculture Extension Framework; (iv) Diploma in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI); (v) Extension Education Institutes (EEIs); (vi) National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) merging NIAM; & (vii) Exhibition/Fairs.  II. SUPPORT TO STATE EXTENSION PROGRAMME FOR EXTENSION REFORMS (ATMA SCHEME GUIDELINES)  2. Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms (ATMA Scheme Guidelines) 2.1 INTRODUCTION: The extension system is an important pillar in agricultural development, to empower farmers with relevant information, technology, skills and support, all of which are necessary to enhance sustainability, farmers income and agriculture as an enterprise. Agriculture provides ample opportunities for the farmers to undertake several income generating agri-enterprises which are on-farm, off-farm and non-farm in nature. Agri-enterprises include nursery, seed production, custom hiring, vermi- composting, bee-keeping, managing common storage, processing units, agri- tourism, milk chilling unit, mushroom cultivation etc. require skills, investment and market linkages. Income addition to farmers through these activities contributes significantly for doubling income not only for the enterprising farmer but also for others who use these quality inputs and services. Extension also needs to focus on these areas so as to create the Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) at Village level. Thus, extension services require re-aligning themselves with Crop Diversification, Integrated Farming System, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Natural Farming, Market-Led Extension, Risk Management, in both production and marketing for sustainable crop production. In order to increase outreach of extension services to large number of farmers and addressing their four common concepts, viz. what to grow?, how to finance?, what input to use? and where & how to sell?, an urgent need was felt to further upscale the existing extension initiatives and revamp the main public extension scheme, i.e. Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA). Need for reforms in Agricultural Extension have been explicitly raised in the report of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI) by 2022. Keeping the recommendations of the DFI report and policy initiatives in view and to strengthen and make ATMA scheme more vibrant, a futuristic vision has been developed to empower the farmers. 2.2 VISION To empower farmers with information, technology, skill, risk and farm management practices across agriculture sub-sectors and commodity specific agriculture value chains, so as to enable them to realize higher net income from their enterprises on a sustainable basis.  2.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES a. The Scheme Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms popularly known as ATMA scheme, aimed at promoting decentralized, farmer friendly extension system in the country with an objective to support State Governments efforts to revamp the agricultural extension system focusing on Natural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop Diversification, National Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card, Digital Agriculture Mission and making available the latest agricultural technologies and good agricultural practices to the farmers. b. Keeping in view the changed focus of ATMA scheme, the objectives of the scheme have been revised as under :- i) More emphases of extension services on post-production management, surplus management and marketing. ii) To converge extension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW in ATMA Cafeteria. iii) Convergence between research and extension. iv) Extension outreach to farmers through Video Conferencing. v) Skill Development Training of Rural Youth (minimum 200 hours). vi) To promote climate resilient agriculture, according to requirement of various agro-climatic zone. vii) Adopting group approach to extension in line with the identified needs and requirements of the farmers in the form of CIGs/FIGs/FSGs and consolidate them as FPOs. viii) Addressing gender concerns by mobilizing women farmers into groups for their capacity building ix) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) based farmers training. 2.4 CHANGES IN THE EXISTING ATMA SCHEME In order to accomplish the vision, guiding elements of DFI report and key objectives/reforms, the following changes have been made in the Scheme:- 2.4.1 Production to Market Orientation: Focus of extension services will be given on marketing aspects along with a quality production. Farmers training shall be organized on the themes of Post-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Agriculture Marketing, various initiatives of Government, etc. For ensuring implementation of activities with changed focus towards marketing, States may take up the following steps:- i. All extension personnel (ATMA & Non-ATMA) are targeted to be trained in market led extension training programmes. The training modules on market led extension for field functionaries and farmers have been developed which may be seen in Annexure-VI & Annexure-VII respectively.  ii. Farmers training programmes (within District) under the scheme henceforth shall be two days duration. Training module shall include RPL based farmers training followed by their up-skilling. A certificate of progressive farmers will be provided to them on successful completion of the training programme. Such farmers trainings shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats. In special cases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a larger scale. The certified progressive farmers are expected to disseminate acquired knowledge and skill among their fellow farmers. The concept of RPL may be seen at Annexure-XII. 2.5. Converge Extension Activities of various Divisions of Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) in ATMA Cafeteria: Extension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW have been identified and made these eligible to converge in ATMA cafeteria. These identified thematic areas include Post-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Marketing, Diversification, Integrated Farming System, Seed Production& Seed Technology, Integrated Development of Horticulture, Soil Health Management, Integrated Pest Management, Agricultural Mechanization, Micro Irrigation, etc. Duration and cost norms along with certification may be as per specified guidelines of respective schemes of various Divisions of DA&FW. 2.6 Convergence of Extension with Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying: Services of Krishi Sakhis & Pashu Sakhis nurtured by DAY-NRLM may be suitably used for creating awareness among the farmers under ATMA Scheme after providing them training in relevant subjects. 2.7 Convergence between Research and Extension: In order to implement convergence circular jointly signed by the DG, ICAR & the Secretary (AC&FW) in letter and spirit, a convergence matrix has been prepared for reporting/monitoring with quantifiable targets as per details given below :- a. Monthly Interface Meeting b. Pre-seasonal Technical Updation c. Farmer-Scientist Interactions at District level d. Designating Experts at District level for instant technical help of ATM/BTM e. Joint Visits in identified villages by ATMA and KVK f. Reporting and Monitoring mechanism. States may ensure regular implementation and reporting of progress on convergence between research and extension on the above matrix. The detailed guidelines regarding convergence may be seen in the Chapter No. IV.  2.8 Extension through Interaction: In order to provide greater opportunities of interaction between farmers and experts on regular basis, a mechanism of Video Conferencing for interaction between experts and farmers shall be made as an eligible activity under ATMA cafeteria. 2.09 Skill Development Training of Rural Youth (Minimum 200 hours): In order to enhance self-employment opportunities and entrepreneurship development in agriculture and allied sectors, Skill Training for Rural Youth component is being included in ATMA. This component was earlier implemented from RKVY funding and skill trainings were conducted through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs). As per revised Guidelines, the District ATMA to implement this component in consultation with respective KVK. 2.10 Promotion of Innovative ATMA set-up based on Agro-Ecological Zones: In order to improve mechanism of agricultural extension system in the country, States may consider various innovative and flexible ideas like organising ATMA activities agro-ecological zones in a district. States may consider such innovative ideas based on the agro-ecological zones in each district prescribing farmers to adopt appropriate technologies and cropping patterns. Manpower support under the scheme, however, shall not exceed the maximum permissible limit, based on the number of administrative districts in State. III. ATMA Set-up & Human Resource (HR) 3.1 ATMA set-up at different levels is given below:- 3.1.1 State Level (i) The State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is the apex body to approve State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) which will form a part of the State Agriculture Plan (SAP). In those cases where SLSC meeting cannot be held in time or there is any other administrative reason, SEWP can be approved by the Executive Committee of SMAE on the recommendation of Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG). (ii) The SLSC may be supported by the IDWG which is responsible for day-to-day coordination and management of the Scheme activities within the State.  (iii) The State Nodal Cell (SNC), consisting of State Nodal officer, State Coordinator, Gender Coordinator and supporting staff (Computer Programmer & Accountant- cum-Clerk) will ensure timely receipt of District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs), formulation of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) duly incorporating farmers feedback obtained through State Farmer Advisory Committee (SFAC) and its approval by the SLSC. The SNC will then convey the approval and monitor implementation of these work plans by State Agricultural Management & Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs) and ATMAs. The SAMETIs will draw- up and execute an Annual Training Calendar for capacity building of the Extension Functionaries in the State. While doing so, the SAMETI will check duplication and overlapping of training content, training schedule, and trainees themselves. The SAMETIs table to ensure effective coordination with MANAGE, Hyderabad for finalizing the Annual Training Calendar through their participation and indepth discussion in the National annual Training Planning Workshop at MANAGE involving all the stakeholders. 3.1.2 District Level ATMA is an autonomous institution set up at district level to ensure delivery of extension services to farmers. ATMA Governing Board is the apex body of ATMA which provides overall policy direction. ATMA Management Committee is the executive body looking after implementation of the scheme. District Farmers Advisory Committee is a body to provide farmers feedback for district level planning and implementation. With dedicated staff provided for the ATMA, it will continue to be the district level nodal agency responsible for overall management of agriculture extension system within the district, including preparation of Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP). The process flow for formulating Action Plans has been described in Para 3.2 below. 3.1.3 Block Level The Block ATMA Cell consisting of Block Technology Team (BTT) (a team comprising officers of agriculture and other allied departments within the block) and Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) (a group exclusively consisting of selected farmers of the block) will prepare the Block Action Plan (BAP) and provide necessary extension support within the Block in its execution. 3.1.4. Village Level (i) The Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system and farmers at village level (one for every two villages). (ii) Agri-entrepreneurs, Diploma holders in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI), Input Dealers and extension workers in non-  governmental sector will supplement the efforts of extension functionaries in public extension system. (iii)Commodity Interest Groups (CIGs), Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) and Food Security Groups (FSGs) will serve as a nodal point for information & technology dissemination among its members and federating in Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs) to ensure group approach. (iv) Farm Schools will serve as a mechanism for farmer-to-farmer extension at every Block. 3.1.5. The organizational structure at various levels has been depicted in the following diagram: DAC&FW MANAGE/EEIs/ SAUs/ICAR STATES (HRD/ACABC/ DAESI)/ EXHIBITIONS State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC)/ IDWG SAMETI & SAU/ICAR State State Farmers Advisory F Institutes NodalCell Committee W U O N R District Farmers Advisory D District Training ATMA K Committee Centre, KVK & ZRS (GB & MC) F P L O BlockTechnology Team Block Block Farmers Advisory L ATMA cell Committee A W N Farmer Agri-Entrepreneurs Farm Schools Friend CIGs, FIGs, FSGs, FARMERS, FPOs 3.1.6. The following Committees shall be set up at various levels.  State Level: (i) Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) (ii) SAMETI Executive Committee (iii) State Farmers Advisory Committee (SFAC)  District Level: (i) ATMA Governing Board (ii) ATMA Management Committee (iii)District Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC)  Block Level: (i) Block Technology Team (BTT) (ii)Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC)  The composition, functions and mandate of these Committees have been given at Annexure III (a) to III (f). 3.2. Process Flow for Action Plans SREP is a comprehensive document identifying research/extension priorities of the district, keeping in mind agro-ecological situations and existing gaps in technology generation & dissemination in all agriculture and allied sector areas/activities including Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries. All extension related activities under other schemes of DA&FW would naturally form part of SREP. SREPs will be prepared in coordination with the line departments, NGOs, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), Private Sector, farmers and other stakeholders at the district level. Similar training & field extension related components in other programmes of DA&FW and State Governments will also be implemented through ATMA. Funds earmarked for such activities under different Schemes/ Programmes will be utilized through ATMA. Similarly, ATMA funds also will be suitably used to cover training & field extension objectives/activities of other Schemes/ Programmes. Such convergence arrived at through SREP/ SEWP will avoid duplication and ensure wider coverage in terms of outreach to farmers and gamut of activities. Various Action Plans shall emanate from SREP as follows: (i) These SREPs are Five-year vision documents which shall be revisited after every 5 years to accommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas of importance viz. market plan based on cross-sector value chain approach, skill development, agri start-ups and off-farm income generating options. (ii) SREPs will form the basis for formulation of Block Action Plans (BAPs) on an annual basis. Block Action Plans are then consolidated at the District level to prepare the District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs). (iii) The DAAPs will be consolidated in the form of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) which then forms a part of consolidated Annual Action Plan (AAP) under KY. 3.3.

The two Deputy PDs would work under the administrative control of PD, ATMA. The duties & responsibilities of PD & Deputy PD Accountant-cum-Clerk and Computer Programmer/Operator are given at Annexure-IV (b). 3.3.3 Block Level: (i) One Block Technology Manager (BTM) is provided in each Block to co- ordinate the ATMA related activities of the BTT and BFAC. BTM will work  under the overall supervision of the BTT Convener for all ATMA related activities at the Block level. (ii) On an average three Assistant Technology Managers (ATMs) are to be placed in each Block (2 to 4 depending on size of the Block) exclusively for delivery of extension services in agriculture and allied sectors as per priority areas for various Blocks. Out of 3 ATM, at least one ATM should be Women. (a) In N.E. States and other hilly States viz. H.P., J&K, and Uttarakhand, the number of ATMs deployed per block should be based on the criteria i.e. Blocks having upto 5000 farm households and the area of the Block being upto 800 sq. kms, 2 ATMs would be deployed. However, if the area of the Block is more than 800 sq.km, 3 ATMs could be considered; (b) In all other States Blocks having upto 12000 farm households and the area of the Block being upto 1000 sq. km, 2 ATMs would be deployed. However, if the number of farm households/Block exceeds 20000 and the area of the block is more than 1000 sq.km, the deployment of ATM can go up to 4. All other Blocks will have 3 ATMs. However, average figure of more than 3 ATMs per state will need to be concurred by the Government of India, so that overall country average does not exceed 3. (c) The areas of expertise (i.e. Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries etc.) of these ATMs will be decided based on priorities for various Blocks. These ATMs shall be provided requisite connectivity and mobility to perform the assigned functions. The duties of BTMs and ATMs are given at Annexure IV (b). (d) Block level and District level manpower available under various schemes will be pooled for regular coverage of groups of Villages/Panchayats for extension related expertise. However, domain expertise of various extension personnel in a Block/District will be suitably used to ensure all-round outreach to farmers. 3.4 Mode of Recruitment and Remuneration: 3.4.1 The BTMs and ATMs at Block Level may be engaged by Project Director (PD), ATMA on contractual /outsource basis through a mechanism identified by the State. BTMs and ATMs should be preferably below 45 years of age (upper age limit of 45 years would, however, not be applicable on those candidates who have already served as BTM/ ATM as they have gained working experience under the scheme), as their work involves extensive travel execution of field activities. While, the ATMs will remain  under the administrative control of BTM, the BTM will work under administrative control of PD, ATMA. 3.4.2 The posts of State Coordinator, Gender Coordinator, BTM & ATM at Block level and Computer Programmer/Computer Operator (at State & District Level) may be filled on contractual /outsource basis with lump-sum remuneration. 3.4.3 Following emoluments are suggested to be paid to the contractual / outsourced manpower: 1. State Coordinator: Rs 60,000/- 2. Gender Coordinator: Rs.50,000/- 3. BTM: Rs.30,000/- 4. ATM Rs 25,000/- 5. Computer Programmer Rs 25,000/- 3.4.4 All other posts (Director SAMETI, Deputy Director SAMETI, PD ATMA, DPD ATMA and Accountant cum Clerk) may be filled by deputation / secondment / appointment for the scheme period or such other mode as the State Government may deem appropriate. State government may take necessary measures to fill up these posts / vacancies by deputation/secondment/appointment only. Henceforth, regular posts may not be filled on contractual/outsource basis. However, States(UTs may retain their existing deployed manpower filled on contract basis viz. Accountant-cum- clerk, Dy. Project Director (ATMA), Dy. Director SAMETI revising their remuneration to Rs. 30,000/ , Rs. 52,000/- and Rs. 55,000/- per month respectively w.e.f. 01.04.2025 till the time these vacancies are filled on regular basis. 3.4.5 Following norms regarding contractual/outsourced manpower may be followed: (i) Concerned contractual/outsourced/regular persons may be given the stipulated emoluments through digital/online mode of payment. (ii) The contractual/outsourced manpower shall also be eligible for getting benefits of EPF, ESIC as admissible from time to time as per prevalent laws & instructions and/or options exercised by the stakeholders concerned. GST, statutory dues, bonus if applicable, as per relevant statutory norms, and contractors margins are to be indicated separately under the expenses shown for manpower component. While renewing the contract, the State Government may give preference to the existing/experienced contractual / outsourced manpower and do not terminate their services without assigning any reason. States may consider contractual /outsourced manpower deployment co-terminus with the scheme. Satisfaction of the Agriculture Department of the State at an appropriate level may be the determining factor regarding continuation of persons after initial period of deployment.  (iii) Annual increase in the remuneration of contractual/outsourced ATMA manpower : Rate for annual increase can be upto 5% for those contractual/outsourced manpower who have already crossed the revised initial ceiling and upto 10% for those contractual/outsourced manpower who have not yet crossed the revised initial ceiling. For example : in case a Computer Programmer (CP) deployed in 2014 with the existing monthly remuneration @ Rs.16,000/- (fixed in 2014) is presently getting gross monthly emoluments more than revised initial ceiling of Rs.25,000/-, he / she will be eligible for getting an annual increase @ upto 5% (flat and not compounding) while a CP who is presently getting only say Rs.18,000/- per month ( i.e. less than the revised initial ceiling ) will be eligible for getting an annual increase @ upto 10% (flat and not compounding), till he/she reaches up to the revised initial ceiling. Note: a) Higher amounts to existing contractual/outsourced manpower are payable only after performance review and screening on the lines described above. While fixing total emoluments to contractual/outsourced manpower of any post at enhanced rate, emoluments should not be less than total emoluments last paid to contractual/outsourced manpower. b) The amounts listed above are upper ceilings for initial fixation of emolument and the State Governments may consider fixing the emoluments accordingly. (iv) If, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the candidates for various posts with prescribed qualifications as given at Annexure-IV(c) are not available, the qualifications may be relaxed by the IDWG subject to ratification by the SLSC under intimation to the Government of India. (v) Leave/maternity leave etc. to contractual/outsourced ATMA manpower may be considered by the States/UTs at par with similarly placed contractual / outsourced manpower in other organizations in the State/UT concerned. 3.4.6 Support for Innovative Activity at Village Level (Farmer Friend) (i) It is necessary to identify and groom progressive farmers (including women farmers) with requisite qualification (Senior Secondary/High School) & experience as Farmer Friend (FF), one per two census villages. In case of non-availability of progressive farmers with requisite qualifications, at some places, a progressive farmer, with  required oral and written communication skills, may be considered. Only experienced and achiever farmers (say, with an age of more than 40 years or so, as the State Government may deem appropriate) are to be designated as Farmer Friends. Preference may be given to awardee/progressive farmers while identifying farmer friend. Farmer Friend will lead by example and is expected to have up-graded skills and would be available in the village to advice on agriculture and allied activities. Since FFs provide a vital link between public extension system and farmers at village level, it is essential to select experienced, progressive and practicing farmers who are not looking forward to this task as an alternative means of livelihood. The Farmer Friend will be identified by BTM on a resolution of Gram Panchayat (GP), which will, in turn, consult CIGs/FIGs working in the Panchayat area. (ii) Farmer Friends will be provided with special opportunity for upgradation of skills through trainings, study tours and visits to SAUs/other institutes, by utilizing support available under ATMA. Rs.18,000/- per Farmer Friend per year will be shared between the Centre and the State as per pattern of assistance approved for all other activities under the scheme to meet contingency expenditure which FF incurs towards discharge of his duties, including incidental expenses incurred on acquisition of knowledge. It should not be perceived as remuneration. It is to clarify that identification of Farmer friends should not be seen as an employment opportunity in the State Government and this was never envisaged under the scheme. IV. CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES ATMA CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES: In order to implement extension activities with special focus on post-harvest management, marketing, etc. as recommended by the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI) by 2022, various extension activities are to be carried out at different levels addressing national priority areas (Annexure-I) suitably contributing in the national goal of doubling of farmers income. Extension services are being re-aligned with sustainability aspects of farming, for crop diversification, integrated farming system, climate resilient agriculture, risk management, Natural Farming in both production and marketing. Additional/innovative extension activities have included to be implemented under ATMA scheme, viz. extension through interaction etc., at Panchayat/Village level for providing door-step services and dissemination of information on Government schemes to farmers.  Unit cost and Activity ceiling limit norms of various Cafeteria activities under ATMA have been revised and indicated at Annexure-V (a). The Cafeteria provides support for State, District and Block level activities. Apart from the national priority areas/thematic areas, States may also choose local area/theme in keeping with location specific needs of farmers for their capacity building as identified in Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) of the District. The details of activities at different levels are given below:- 4.1 State Level (A): A.1 Monitoring and Evaluation: This activity includes three review workshops and R-E-F Linkage before each crop season (Rabi, Kharif and Zaid) on annual basis @ 1.00 lakh per workshop, concurrent monitoring & evaluation and expenses on IDWG meetings and other contingencies including opex for SNC, SC, GC including expenditure on convening meeting of SFAC. A.2 Training Courses: This item includes training programmes for National/Inter- State/Within State (SAMETI Level) for both Government and Non- Government extension functionaries (A.2.a), Induction Training of ATMA field functionaries (A.2.b), Refresher training of all ATMA field functionaries (A.2.c), Workshop for development of Quality Resource material (A.2.d).One DPD out of two at District level and one ATM out of three at Block level are to be essentially trained in marketing in order to acquaint them with market expertise. A.3 Exposure Visit of Extension functionaries: In order to enhance capacity building and expertise of extension functionaries, a provision of their exposure visit and PRI members to progressive States have been made in the guidelines.

B.1 Development of SREP: Strategic Research Extension Plan (SREP) is essential for formulating State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) and annual action Plan(AAP). This document is prepared adopting integrated farming system approach, where extension and research gaps of all the sub-systems are identified through participatory methods. SREP is re-visited after every five years to accommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas. The committee on DFI has since recommended paradigm shift from production to market-led-extension, States may include new areas in revised SREP like market-led-extension,mitigate crop loses, Skill Development, agri-start- ups and income generating livelihood options. B.2 Farmers Training: Farmers Training is an important component of capacity building of farmers in latest agriculture technologies and adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs). Farmers Training would focus on thrust areas like Natural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop Diversification, National Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card, Digital Agriculture Mission etc. In order to maintain quality of farmers training, farmers training shall be conducted in the specialized subject matter institutions viz: ICAR Institutes/ State Agriculture Universities/State Agricultural Management & Training Institutes/ MANAGE/ EEIs and KVKs etc. [Annexure-V(a)]. i. Under Inter-State and within State training of farmers activity, cost norms are inclusive of : (i) Travel cost by bus or second class sleeper (actual cost); (ii) Refreshments/Meals and Stay during training, (iii) Expenditure on training, training material; (iv) Training kit and agricultural inputs, if any; (v) Cost of honorarium and/or travel of the trainer (actual); (vi) Miscellaneous food cost during travel, if any, and(vii) Field visits etc. ii. The amounts indicated in the cafeteria are top activity ceilings and only the actual cost should be paid after exercising economy. The Progress Reports should contain only these actual amounts. Any deviation from  these cost norms of training under items B.2 (a) to (c) should be got approved by the IDWG which includes States Finance Secretary. In case of within district farmers training, likely expenditure or State/location specific cost norms needs to be got approved in advance by the ATMA Governing Board. iii. Duration of the farmers training for inter-state, intra-State shall be 7days & 5 days respectively, excluding journey time. Farmers training programmes (within District) under the scheme would be 2 days duration and these shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats. In special cases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a larger scale. iv. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that all panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of farmers is not permissible, except when theme of training is different. Other guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in Chapter-VII. v. States shall develop module for these farmers training in consultation with domain experts. Training module shall include recognizing the Prior learning of farmers followed by their up-skilling by way of training. A certificate of progressive farmers will be provided to them on successful completion of the training programme. The certified progressive farmers are expected to disseminate acquired knowledge and skill among their fellow farmers. Farmer Trainings may be organized by ATMA through respective domain experts of ICAR/KVKs, SAUs, National/State level Institutes, Government agencies and specialized Institutes etc. vi. The identified thematic areas of farmers training include: National Priority Areas/Themes:- (i) Post-harvest management (ii) Organic production clusters (iii) Market led extension (iv) Seed production and seed technology aspects (v) Integrated farming, climate resilient cropping system, adaptation and good agricultural practices. (vi) Integrated pest management practices in major crops (vii) Holistic growth of Horticulture sector covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cocoa and bamboo.

B.3 Demonstrations: i. Demonstration with an embedded philosophy of seeing is believing is an important extension activity to teach new knowledge and skills to farmers. Demonstration shall be organized in those areas which have not been covered under other Schemes / Missions / Sub-Missions of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Notified varieties for climate resilient agriculture and bio-fortified varieties of different crops would be promoted through these extension activities. Appropriate publicity should be accorded to the Demonstration and Farm Schools so that benefits can reach to the large number of farmers. A provision of Rs.6,000/- per acre is made under the scheme for one demo (Photographs of the event will be uploaded on Krishi Mapper). This provision shall be used for soil testing , seeds of improved variety of crops, fertilizer, IPM, display board etc. Selected farmer may also organize a controlled plot demonstration of 1 acre at his own cost, so that a comparison can be drawn. Soil Testing /Soil Health Card is mandatory for conducting Demonstration. ii. Demonstration shall be organized in a plot of 1 acre land, at place easily approachable/accessible to other farmers. There should be a prominent display board at the selected plot indicating the details of demonstration activity. iii. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that all panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of  farmers is not permissible, except when crop of demonstration is different. Other guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in Chapter-IX. iv. For wider dissemination and increased outreach, State is expected to suitably popularize the demonstration activity among the targeted farmers. State may use various modes of publicity for reaching large number of farmers. B.4 Exposure Visits of Farmers: The exposure visits of farmers to exemplary farms either inter-state, within state and within district are considered as the best form of learning from new farming practices and modern, scientific and innovative farm technologies. Exposure visits of farmers will be conducted in national / international/ regional/ state and district level Agri-Fairs wherein advanced agriculture technologies are show-cased for creating awareness among large number of farmers.Travel and staying together with fellow farmers affords more time and is a good opportunity to share each others experiences and establish rapport, which can result in actual adoption. The cost norms for inter-state, within state and within district exposure visits for farmers of General/NER States per manday are indicated in cafeteria table. B.5 Mobilization of Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs): Group approach is central to the restructured extension mechanism to make extension more demand-driven. ATMA is envisaged as a very effective instrument for promoting participatory planning and group based approaches with focus on learning and empowerment. The aim is to redirect extension activities towards diversification into high value crops and products thereby increasing farm income and rural employment. With this market-driven approach to extension, it was envisaged that the ATMA body will make efforts to promote group of farmers and organize them around specific crops for commodities. These village level FIGs/CIGs are to be ultimately federated at Block/District level such as Block Level Farmers Association, District Level Farm Federations, etc. so as to make the technology generation/dissemination farmer-driven and farmer- accountable. A provision of Rs.10,000/- per FIG has been provided for mobilization of 1 group of 20 farmers and Rs.25,000/- as seed money (revolving fund) for viable FIG/CIG. There is a capping of 20 groups per  block per year. FIGs/CIGs/FSGs are required to be federated as Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs). Women Food Security Groups (B.5.c): Rural women play a very important role in agriculture. As such, it is proposed that ATMA should lay focus and address womens issues through special interventions. To ensure food and nutritional security at the household level, it is proposed to support promotion of Farm womens Food Security Groups (FSGs). These FSGs would be provided support for training, publication and access to inputs @ Rs.25,000/- per group. It is proposed that minimum 2 FSGs per Block per year is mandated under the scheme. These FSGs would serve as Model Food Security Hubs through establishing kitchen garden, backyard poultry, goatery, animal husbandry & dairying, mushroom cultivation, etc. These groups would essentially be provided input support including small tools, seeds, planting material for setting up backyard food security garden @ Rs.25,000/- per group. B.6 Farmer Awards: To incentivize best farmers representing different enterprises, a provision of Rs.10,000/- per farmer per year has been made. State may device a transparent mechanism to select the best farmers in relevant enterprise involving technical and scientific agencies. In identifying potential awardees, preference may be given to the farmers recognized for their production/productivity or progressive farmers recognized for their innovative farming practices. These individuals may be actively involved at block or village-level activities such as Farm Schools and other local agricultural initiatives, contributing to the communitys development and knowledge sharing. B.7 to B.9 Farm Information Dissemination through exhibitions, Mass Media, publication: This includes local level agricultural exhibitions, low cost publications, information dissemination through printed materials and development of technology packages in electronic form. The cost norms of these activities may be seen in Annexure-V(a). B.10 to B.12 Agriculture Technology Refinement, Validation and Adoption This includes to designate expert for each District from the Scientists of KVKs/SAUs, organization of Farmer-Scientist Interaction at local level, joint visits by scientist and extension personnel for which substantial financial provision has been made in the cafeteria, organization of Field- days and Kisan Goshthies and assessment, refinement, validation & adoption for frontline technologies and other short term researchable  issues through KVKs and other local research centres. Cost norms of these activities are clearly indicated in the cafeteria. While designating District level experts from KVKs/SAUs, only those Scientists may be considered who have already participated in carrying out Farmers- Scientists-Interaction (FSIs) activity. Farmer Friend (FF) and Agri-Advisors (AAs) should also be involved actively in FSIs. B.13 Administrative expenses:- As per details given in cafeteria. B.14 Farm Schools :- (i)An important means to upgrade the process of dissemination of information in agriculture and allied sector is farmer-to-farmer approach, which is found to be very pertinent. The key feature of the Farm Schools being promoted under ATMA is that at least three Farm Schools to be set up in each Block in the field of outstanding or achiever farmers. Farm Schools and Farm School Trainers for each season would be finally approved by the ATMA GB; main activities of Farm Schools would be to operationalize frontline demonstrations in one hectare land in one or more crops/allied sector activities. Farm Schools would provide season long technical backstroking/training to target farmers by having an interactive session one at least during each of the four critical stages in a cropping season. 50% representation may be given to small and marginal farmers while selecting the trainees of the Farm Schools. Now, Farm Schools (FS) will be organized in two models viz: Model I- at Progressive Farmers field @ Rs.32,400/FS and Model-II - at Awardee farmers field @ Rs.20,200/FS. Number of Critical stages have been reduced from existing Six to Four stages namely (i) Crown Root Initiation, (ii) Tillering, (iii) Flowering and (iv) Milk & Dough stage. (ii) The detailed concept of Farm School and item-wise cost norms may be seen in Annexure-V(b). B.15 Farmer Friend: The Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system and farmers at village level (one for every two villages). An amount of Rs.18,000/- per annum is payable to a farmer friend as a contingency amount.  C Innovative Activities: In order to encourage States for taking up innovative work in extension, it is proposed to provide Rs.25.00 lakh at State level and at District level @ Rs.0.50 lakh per block. For taking up innovative activities at State and District level, approval/rectification in the IDWG meeting would be required. Various innovative activities include: C.1 PG Diploma in Agricultural Extension Management or Agricultural Marketing Management :- PGDAEM or PGDAMM for in-service extension functionaries continue to be implemented through MANAGE/NIAM releasing central share directly to MANAGE. C.2 Innovative Activities-State level C.3 Innovative Activities-District level C.4 SETTING UP OF COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS (CRSs) i. Community Radio Stations (CRS) have to be promoted in a big way to expand the reach of localised technologies to the farmers located within a radius of 20 to 50 Kilometers. ii. A total amount of not more than Rs.65 lakh (including capital and recurring cost) is proposed to be provided as assistance for CRS spread over operational period.There will be a ceiling of Rs.14.50 lakh on the capital cost but the same can be reviewed if substantially higher range than the present standard of 20 Kms. radius is proposed to be covered. Support for content creation at a rate not exceeding Rs.3,500/-per hour normally with a diminishing support structure of 730,540 and 200 hours respectively for first, second and third year will be provided. Some NGOs and KVKs may also use innovative technologies meeting minimum system requirement or contribution from some private players to reduce the capital cost. Subject to compliance of minimum technical specification for setting up of Community Radio Station, break-up of Rs.65.00 lakh is permitted to be changed from capital cost to recurring cost or recurring cost from one year to another. If cost of production can be reduced without diluting quality norms or there is some other financial support like advertisement, revenue or part of capital cost is diverted to recurring expenditure or a time lag between setting-up of CRS and start of  programmes, recurring cost also can be taken to even beyond three years subject to overall cost ceiling. Further, year-wise cost ceilings per CRS have been given in the Cafeteria of Activities (D.2) iii. Funding to private institutions along with Government and Quasi- government organizations for setting up Community Radio Stations (CRSs) can be considered. iv. Community based organizations, Agencies/NGOs registered under Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other such Act and recognized by the Central Government/State Government and serving in Agriculture and allied areas including SAUs and/KVKs are eligible for funding. Registration at the time of application should be at least three years old. v. The willing Organizations should have basic infrastructure and facilities in the form of a room of about 400 sq. feet/ electricity/ necessary manpower to run and operate the CRSs. vi. ATMA MC of the District concerned may select suitable proposal/s; recommend them to the Nodal Officer/Commissioner of Agriculture of the concerned State for onward transmission to DAC through the competent committee, i.e., the IDWG having representation of SAU/ICAR Institutes/KVKs concerned so that the proposals are not referred again to ICAR by I&B Ministry which causes a considerable delay in granting approvals. vii. The PD, ATMA would regularly review the performance of CRSs along with other activities with the BTMs. In addition, ATMA GB would review the performance in detail with regard to content creation, involvement of local community, suitability to local conditions, release/utilization of funds for/by CRS and convergence & synergy with SAU/KVKs. viii. Any organization already sought CRS funding for 3 years will not be eligible for funding again under the Scheme. D Manpower Support Details are given in chapter-III of this Guidelines and initial monthly remuneration rates mentioned in Activity D of ATMA Cafeteria,2025.  B11(a) Farmer Scientist Interactions at District level Farmer Scientist interactions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers concerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help in bringing forth various technological options for the coming season which is suited to the local situations. ATMA Cafeteria provides for Farmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2 days @Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 3 such interactions, one before each crop season per year may be organised in each district with active involvement of local KVK, SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the district. B11(b) Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Joint visits by the PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level KVK/SAU/ICAR scientists greatly helps in creating a common understanding of field level technological issues and providing an integrated solution to the problems faced by the farmers. In order to ensure proper mobility for field visits of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provided under ATMA cafeteria for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/- per visit per district. A.9 Extension through Interaction : In order to provide greater opportunities of interaction between farmers and experts on regular basis, a mechanism through constitution of expert committees is proposed at State and National levels with involvement of domain experts of Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries, Veterinary, Sericulture and Agricultural Marketing, weather & meteorology etc. including those from banking and insurance sector. For answering farmers queries and to resolve their problems from a single platform on a regular basis, it is proposed to put in place two Committees viz. State Level Expert Committee and Central Level Expert Committee. The State Level Expert Committee (SLEC) is proposed to interact with farmers of the State through Video Conferencing on quarterly basis. It is proposed to collect, collate and prioritize farmers queries related to agriculture and all allied sectors across complete value chain i.e. from production to marketing, including other critical areas such as soil health, water use efficiency,waste/residue management etc. from all Blocks/Districts of a State using ATMA network. All important District Level queries are proposed to be documented at the level of State Nodal Cell (SNC). SNC is responsible to coordinate and implement interaction between farmers and scientists on regular basis through video conferencing. The cost norms for this activity are given at A.9 of the cafeteria. The mechanism for Video Conferencing would be as under:-  a) Interaction of 20-25 farmers per district with State Level Expert Committee (SLEC) at NIC District Centres. b) Such Video Conference may be organized on quarterly basis. a) Farmers queries to be sourced from ATM/BTM at Blocks to PD/ATMA at District to State Nodal Cell(SNC). b) SNCs to scrutinize the farmers queries and prepare reply through experts. c) Live interaction of experts with farmers on designated day through Video Conference. d) Webcasting of VC for larger dissemination Suggestive composition of State Level Expert Committee (SLSC) would be as under:- SN Designation Status 1. Agriculture Production Commissioner/ Prin. Chairman Secretary (Agri.) /Secretary (Agri.) 2. Director of Agriculture Vice-Chairman 3. Director of Horticulture Member 4. Director of Animal Husbandry Member 5. Director of State Marketing Board Member 6. Director of Sericulture/Fishery/Veterinary etc. Member 7. Directors (ICAR Institutes located in the State) Member 8.

Administrative Expenditure including TA/DA, hiring of vehicles and POL and operational expenses at District/Block level shall not exceed the amount provided for in the cafeteria. Financial allocation has been made specifically for the conduct of BFAC, DFAC, and joint visits of Scientists & Extension Functionaries under the cafeteria. The States should compute their budgetary requirements for mandatory activities, cafeteria activities as per States priorities, manpower support and emoluments as per approved norms. Any savings in administrative expenses can be diverted to other categories but not vice versa.  (ii) The norms as laid down in these Guidelines have to be adhered to but in exceptional cases and for reasons to be recorded in writing, ATMA Governing Board (GB) may go beyond these ceilings by up to 10% without exceeding overall allocation. Similarly, IDWG can authorize relaxation of up to 15%. All such cases shall have to be reported in next years Work Plan so that appropriate advisories can be issued. Any deviation of more than 15% from the prescribed norms/ceilings or any activity not specified in the guidelines can be taken up by States only with the prior approval of DA&FW.  V.Convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension  V. Convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension 5. With a view to improve farm income and livelihood security of the farming households, the Government has been implementing number of programmes under various Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored schemes through the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. This can be facilitated to a great extent through a demand driven technology development and its transfer to farmers in an effective way with a focus on ensuring convergence of efforts at different levels for rendering an integrated service delivery to the farmers. In particular, the linkages between National Agriculture Research System (NARS) and extension machinery at cutting edge level need to be strengthened. 5.1 While the concept of district level Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) has been promoted with an idea to provide a platform for integrated extension delivery involving all the stakeholders, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) operating at the same level act as an outreach arm of National Agricultural Research System (NARS) facilitating validation and adoption of new technologies through frontline demonstrations, training & awareness programmes and other initiatives. 5.2 A detailed circular on research-extension convergence was last issued on 17th June, 2015 under joint signatures of Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare and Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research & Education & DG, ICAR indicating agreed and actionable points for both extension system in the State (represented by ATMA) and the NARS (represented by the State Agricultural Universities, ICAR Research Institutes and KVKs at the cutting edge level. There has been varying levels of progress in implementation of these guidelines across the States. The situation has been reviewed in light of operational concerns expressed by different stakeholders in implementation of these guidelines and recent developments at policy and operational front which require reiterating salient points of the earlier circular apart from new initiatives. 5.3 In order to ensure that the technology development for grass root level is demand driven and captures the critical gaps existing at technology and extension front, the farmers are able to gain desired benefits out of these interventions .The action points which have been agreed between the two departments are elaborated in the following paras :- 5.4 All the steps as laid down in the revised ATMA Guidelines to ensure better convergence between research and extension will be considered to utilize the built- in provisions under the ATMA Cafeteria. i. Farmer Scientist Interactions (FSI) at District level: Farmer Scientist interactions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers concerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help in bringing forth various technological options for the coming season  which is suited to the local situations. ATMA Cafeteria provides for Farmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2 days @Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 2 such interactions, one before each crop season per year may be organized in each district with active involvement of local KVK and SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the district. ii. The SAU may designate an expert who would be in-charge of one District to provide instant guidance to extension functionaries in the District. He/she will work in tandem with District Head of Agriculture and Allied Departments, Project Director ATMA and Programme Coordinator, KVK. A fixed amount of Rs.3000/- per month per district has been provided to meet expert honorarium of these officials related to returning calls of the farmers and other stakeholders that they may receive. IDWG may decide on break-up of the amount among four such officers as above in every district after considering mobile phone expenses already being reimbursed by the State Government and other organisations concerned and actual comparative necessity. iii. Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Joint visits by the PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level KVK/SAU/ICAR scientists greatly helps in creating a common understanding of field level technological issues and providing an integrated solution to the problems faced by the farmers. In order to ensure proper mobility for field visits of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provided under ATMA cafeteria for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/-per visit per district. iv. Organization of Kisan Goshthies: To strengthen Research  Extension  Farmer linkages 1 Kisan Goshthi per block in each of the 2 seasons is envisaged in the ATMA cafeteria. KVK and SAU Scientists may plan the same with PD, ATMA and actively participate in the said event. Cost norm revised to Rs. 25000 per programme. v. Assessment, Refinement, Validation & adoption of Frontline technologies and other short-term researchable issues: ATMA cafeteria provided Rs.7.00 lakh per district for undertaking research or refinement and validation of technologies arising out of the Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP) or any of those which are to be undertaken through KVKs and other local Research Centres. vi. ATMA Management Committee having Programme Coordinator, KVK as its member may review the progress of technology application - related activities funded by ATMA. Besides this, the KVK may also provide an Agricultural Technology Update (ATU) on half-yearly basis  i.e. before the start of Kharif and Rabi crop seasons to the ATMA for its wider dissemination among the farmers of the district. vii. Interface meeting: Programme Coordinators of the KVKs in the District besides participating in the ATMA Governing Board should also have an interface meeting with the Project Director, ATMA once a month during the cropping season and work out a strategy of providing crop advisories to farmers for various stages of crop growth. Scientists available in the KVKs will advise and mentor Block Technology Teams in identifying technological needs in various Blocks in the District and programmatic interventions to meet such needs. viii. Conduct of Field Days, Kisan Melas and Goshthies: ATMA and KVK should coordinate with each other in the conduct of Field Days, Kisan Melas, Goshthies and setting up of Farm Schools, so that there is no duplication in coverage and they should ensure percolation of appropriate scientific practices down to the field level. ix. Release of Fund to KVKs: Funds for KVK activities under ATMA programme will be released directly to KVKs under intimation to respective controlling authorities i.e. Director Extension Education (DEE) & Comptroller and Directors of ICAR Institute in case of KVKs run by Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutes respectively. For the KVKs run by NGOs, funds will be released directly to KVKs under intimation to Zonal Project Directors of the zone concerned. Utilisation Certificates for the funds released by ATMA will be provided by the KVKs only. However, the respective host organisations and monitoring authorities (i.e. Agricultural Universities, ICAR institutes and Zonal Project Directors) will continue to supervise all activities of KVKs including the ones related to ATMA. x. Documentation of Researchable Issues: The long term researchable issues may be documented, agro-climatic zone-wise with the involvement of Zonal Agricultural Research Stations (ZARS). These issues will be formally communicated to the concerned ZARS through the respective SAUs with the approval of the Inter- Departmental Working Group (IDWG). The IDWG having Vice- Chancellor/s of SAUs as well as Director(s) of ICAR institutes in the State as its members will review the progress of research work taken up by the ZARSs on such issues. xi. Implementation of Flagship Programmes: KVKs will provide advice to ATMA and the District Administration for the implementation of Flagship programmes of the DA&FW covered under RKVY and Krishonnati Yojana. The KVK Scientists will technically advise the Block Technology Teams (BTTs) and will also be actively involved in  preparation of Block Action Plans (BAPs), especially with regard to research related issues/gaps and strategies. Regular participation of a KVK scientist in the meetings of Block Technology Teams will be ensured at least once in a quarter. The participating scientist will also take feedback for his colleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective areas of expertise. xii. Involvement of SAUs/KVKs in Training and capacity building of Extension Functionaries under ATMA and Kisan Call Centres: The SAUs and KVKs act as a repository of technologies in agriculture and allied sector suited to specific local situations. Their active involvement in organizing orientation and refresher training programmes for these functionaries would greatly help them updating their technological knowledge for a better extension delivery. xiii. Data Entry of Demonstrations by KVKs and SAUs: Data on demonstrations being organised by district ATMAs for agriculture and allied sectors (including diversification from one sector to another) is being entered in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS) (https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). The details of the same can be fetched from ERMS as well as from the Farmers Portal clicking at the link provided therein. However, some very useful and effective demonstrations carried out by SAUs / KVKs etc. have not been entered and thus not made part of the drillable database at the link given in the Farmers Portal. State Agricultural Universities (including Horticultural, Veterinary and Fisheries), Zonal Project Directors and KVKs to start doing data entry on the ERMS interface, so that farmers can know about the demonstrations of their interest that are taking place in their area and a scientific analysis of efficacy of various agricultural practices, new technologies, varieties of seeds/species etc. can be carried out. xiv. Use of mKisan Portal for Sending Text and Voice Based Advisories to Farmers: The mKisan Portal launched by the DA&FW provides a very useful interface for sending text and voice based advisories to Farmers. Scientist working in ICAR Headquarters, Zonal Project Directors, Research Institutes, & AICRPs, SAUS and KVKs may register as users in the portal and keep sending useful and need based advisories to targeted farmers using the mKisan interface. Feedback may be taken from farmers during Field Visits about usefulness of advisories. xv. Involvement of Scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs in providing Technical Backstopping to the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs): The scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs may be nominated to act as Call Conferencing experts with the Kisan Call Centres  operating in respective States to answer the query of farmers which the Farm Tele Advisors (FTAs) at the KCCs are not able to answer. The Heads of Concerned Institutions may send a Roster of nominated experts at Monthly/Fortnightly intervals to the KCCs designated for the concerned States available on the link http://mkisan.gov.in/kccstatesinvolvement.aspx. Similarly the Scientists from SAUs and SMSs in the KVKs may also be mapped in the Call Escalation Matrix of the Kisan Call Centres to provide their comments to State/District level officers of Agriculture and allied sector on the farmers queries escalated to them through KKMS as detailed at the link http://mkisan.gov.in/kccescalationmatrix.aspx. 5.5 Additional requirement of TA/DA, etc. will be met by the respective Departments from their own budgetary allocations. However, funds available under ATMA Cafeteria for Research-Extension-Farmer linkages may also be appropriately utilized. 5.6 Senior officials from DA&FW and DARE/ICAR would be visiting the States from time to time to review the progress in getting better coordination and interface between the scientific community and the State agriculture machinery on the one hand and the farmers on the other. 5.7 State Governments shall give wide publicity to this arrangement and furnish report on regular basis on the convergence matrix in prescribed format given at Annexure-II of ATMA Guidelines, 2025.  VI. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER SCHEMES  6. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION WORK WITH OTHER SCHEMES 6.1.1. Farmers skill trainings and field extension as contained in other schemes of DA&FW may be converged with similar farmer-related activities going on through ATMA. Thus, for instance, Seed Village programmes under SMSP, capacity building of farmers through institutions identified by the State Government under SMAM and pest monitoring, Farmer Field Schools & Integrated Pest Management (IPM) trainings to farmers under SMPP will only be carried out through the district level institutions of ATMA and Block Technology Teams. Mutually synergetic linkages will be established among various activities instead of unilaterally mandating that all such farmer-centric activities shall be carried out through ATMA. For instance, half days training given under Seed Village Programme shall also be made part of Farm Schools as, in any case, training on seed technologies form a part of 6 critical stages during which farmers are trained under Farm Schools conducted under ATMA. This convergence should be institutionalized by ensuring that State Extension Work Plan [which emanates from Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP)] covers field level training & extension components. SREP is an ideal platform to provide convergence from the conceptual level and prioritization point of view. IDWG will further underline such a convergent approach at the State level. 6.1.2 A single ATMA Governing Board headed by the District Magistrate will provide commonality in approach & implementation and avoid duplication. ATMA Governing Board shall act as an over-arching umbrella at District level to oversee all extension related activities in other schemes of Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM- RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY). Such a holistic approach will avoid duplication of efforts and promote more extensive & inclusive coverage of beneficiaries. The Integrated ICT platforms (such as Farmers Portal, State Agriculture Portals, Central Agriculture Portal) will also provide requisite impetus to implementation in the field level. 6.1.3.Convergence with other Farmer Centric Schemes of DA&FW: With the given man-power support, ATMAs will also look after the work related to other schemes of Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY). There should be full convergence of extension related work being carried out under different programmes/schemes. The field level extension workers under these different programmes/schemes should work in conjunction with the dedicated manpower being provided under this Scheme under the umbrella of BTT or ATMA, as the case may be.  While these extension related workers & consultants under other schemes/programmes can continue to act as experts in their respective fields, they should also double up as multifunctional extension workers in the jurisdiction to be assigned to them by the BTT/ATMA. Budget for extension related components in different schemes and programmes of DA&FW shall be dovetailed at district level through ATMA. Once all the extension related workers start working in unison, they shall be fully responsible for achieving convergence & synergy in extension related work under PM-RKVY and KY Schemes to achieve complementarities and check duplication of efforts and resources. 6.1.4. Convergence with Research System: ATMA scheme provides for active involvement of Research System/ Research Agencies at different levels of implementation. State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have to be fully involved not only in preparation of SREP and Extension Work Plans but also in implementation of various programmes in the field. They will be represented in all bodies, namely, ATMA GB and ATMA MC in districts, SLSC/ IDWGs at State level, BTT - BFAC Meetings at Block level. In addition, each KVK scientist may be made in charge of one or more Blocks within the district. The KVK Scientist will technically advise the BTT and will also be actively involved in preparation of BAPs, especially with regard to research related issues/gaps and strategies. He will also take feedback from his colleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective areas of expertise. A joint circular on convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension signed by the Secretary (DARE) & DG, ICAR and the Secretary (A&C) was issued to all concerned on 17th June, 2015. 6.1.5 Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Quite often it has been seen that scientists of the Universities and ICAR Institutions refrain from making field visits due to inadequate provision of mobility in their budget. In order to ensure proper mobility of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds have been provisioned for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL expenses for field visits of scientists along with extension functionaries. It is expected that at-least 5 pre- identified villages would be covered in a month under the visit. 6.1.6 Convergence with Development Departments: Necessary convergence with all line departments is to be ensured through their involvement in the process of preparation of SREP and Work Plans at Block, District & State levels. Work Plans to be submitted to  SLSC for approval should specify the activities which are to be supported out of resources from other schemes and activities which are to be funded under ATMA Scheme. Necessary convergence is to be ensured through integration of Comprehensive District Action Plans (CDAPs) and District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs)  all of which will form an integral part of Annual Action Plan(AAP) to be approved by State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) under Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY).). Further, within approved allocations of Scheme, the State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) may also approve inter component changes as per need during the course of implementation of the Work Plan, within ambit of Guidelines, which should be reported to DA&FW immediately. Active involvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the selection of beneficiaries for various farmer oriented activities, including selection of Farmer Friend should be ensured. 6.1.7 Convergence with & Involvement of Non-Governmental Sector: (a) In order to ensure promotion of multi-agency extension strategies, and to implement scheme activities in Service Provider mode, at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at district level is to be incurred through Non-Governmental Sector viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para- Extension Workers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will be eligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities (but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity. Outsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the organization concerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower deployed under ATMA is unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious tasks. Agri-preneurs under ACABC can also be covered for this 10% service charge and 100% cost of activity after they clear their loan liability though they can be called as experts on honorarium anytime for any training organized otherwise. These organizations are free to voluntarily contribute to the cost of training or fully/partially bear the service charges. Exclusion of any Agri-preneurs or Para-extension workers from this category which are considered big enough can be done at the discretion of the State Governments concerned. These agencies will be identified at the district level on the basis of merit  and approval of ATMA (GB) will be obtained. Competitive and transparent bidding process for this as per extent rules and regulations and financial norms. Expenditure incurred by the State Government for extension work (viz. service provider mode) shall count towards the threshold figure of 10% as stipulated in sub-para (a) above. 6.2. NETWORKING: State level bodies/ officers viz. State Nodal Officer/ State Coordinator/ Gender Coordinator will ensure networking of all ATMAs so as to foster information sharing (success stories, best practices, research/ extension issues, application of innovative technologies & strategies, etc.). All States/Districts shall share information regarding their activities/ innovations/ successes to the outside world on the national ATMA portal (www.extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). Also progress of the scheme activities shall be reported on the national ATMA portal. This Portal shall also have links to related websites both at State and National level.  VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION  7. MONITORING & EVALUATION (M&E)/Monitoring Framework: 7.1 In order to ensure quality of extension activities, following monitoring framework is provided in the revised guidelines at different levels: i. At Block Level: Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) and Block Technology Team (BTT) constituted under the Scheme will monitor Block level ATMA activities on quarterly basis by conducting a meeting of farmers along- with elected representatives of panchayat. Farmer Friend / ATM will coordinate and facilitate these meetings. Feedback of the meeting will be shared with the district-level agency for suitably incorporating in the future planning for improving effectiveness of the Scheme. Block Action Plan (BAP) will be prepared at block level in consultation with BFAC & BTT. ii. At District Level: ATMA Governing Board headed by DM or CDO or CEO as decided by DM will review and monitor District level ATMA activities in every quarter and decide integration and re-designing of on-going developmental schemes in accordance with the Strategic Research and Extension Plans (SREP) of the District. The Governing Board will provide policy directions that support effective functioning of ATMA in the district and amend the rules and bye-laws for the agency. ATMA management committee and District Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC) will provide input for developing District Annual Agriculture Plan (DAAP) incorporating BAPs of all the blocks in the district. PD, ATMA of the district will coordinate and facilitate convening of the meetings of ATMA, GB / ATMA, MC / DFAC at prescribed intervals. iii. At State Level: State Nodal Cell (ATMA) compile District Annual Agriculture Plan (DAAP) of all the districts at the state level in the form of State Extension Work Plan (SEWP) and place it before the Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) in the meeting for consideration and approval before sending AAP to the SLSC constituted under the Chairperson-ship of the Chief Secretary of the State for approval of AAP of both PM-RKVY and KY Schemes. The IDWG  under the chairperson-ship of APC/Pr. Secretary (Agriculture), may continue with the day to day (in its quarterly meetings) monitoring to ensure that the extension reforms are executed in line with the provisions contained in ATMA Guidelines. There is an in built provision in the Cafeteria of ATMA Activities to carry out concurrent evaluation for regular improvement in the quality of the schematic activities. It deals with things such as when the programme activities occur, where they occur, and who delivers them. Thus, it involves the evaluation of all the activities under taken to achieve programme objectives. The feedback generated through this evaluation can be used for improving implementation of the programme by focusing on mid-season / term correction. The concurrent evaluation is to be undertaken every year during the course of implementation of the schematic activities. The purpose is to conduct a broad based SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis so that mid-course correction is initiated at the appropriate point of time. State Nodal Officer (ATMA) will coordinate and facilitate to convene the meetings of IDWG and SLSC at the prescribed periodic intervals. iv. At National Level: Progress of extension work done by ATMAs through different extension activities shall also be monitored at national level on quarterly basis under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary (Extension). Joint Director (Extension Reforms) will initiate proposal to convene the National Level Review Meetings of ATMA activities on quarterly basis. A web-based interface (https://extensionreforms.da.gov.in) has been provided for regular monitoring of the progress of extension activities. Individual data of farmers under training, exposure visits and demonstrations needs to be entered in the web-based interface using the ICT infrastructure already available in the states. Nodal Officers (State-Wise) will be identified at national level for field monitoring of ATMA activities. Extensive touring of the officers of the DA&FW / Directorate of Extension / MANAGE Faculty will be carried out for on the spot monitoring of the field activities being undertaken under the scheme.  7.2 Cumulative Monthly Progress Reports (MPRs) for each district are to be uploaded by the Project Director, ATMA in a web-based interface available at https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.inby day 5 of the following month. After ensuring that all the districts have entered their data, the SNO will validate this data for the entire State by day 10 of the following month. Submission of manual/ physical reports may be gradually phased out. The progress shall be given online on ERMS portal as digitized data is essentially required for monitoring progress on DBT portal. Effective M&E will be ensured through regular field visits of Inter Disciplinary Teams in project areas, reports, interfaces, conferences etc. The scheme also provides for Concurrent Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) which will be carried out by Government of India. DA&FW will also organize concurrent M&E including impact evaluation as needed as part of its scheme Extension Support to Central Institutes/DOE. Besides, all activities of the scheme would continue to be reviewed on quarterly basis in meetings held at National Level. 7.3 For effective and efficient management of ATMA Scheme, the MoAFW will reply on the data sharing mechanism of Agri Stack, Agri Stack is a Digital public infrastructure which captures and maintains farmer registry, crops sown registry, and geo-referenced village maps. The relevant data pertinent to implementation of schemes will be consumed electronically (using open APIs) for the purposes of beneficiary identification, verification, benefit delivery and monitoring -pertaining to the states, Districts, villages where the data is available. The information as and when collected and collated in the Farmers registry, digital crop surveys, and geo- referenced village maps will be used for implementation of this scheme. Field on which data will be available in AgriStack is given at Annexure. 7.4 Progress of extension work done by ATMs at Block Level, Farm Schools, Demonstration Plots, Trainings, Exposure Visits and Farmer Friends will be closely monitored using ICT infrastructure and by regular monitoring & meetings by BTT at block level, ATMA at district level and SLSC at State level. A web-based interface (https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in) has been provided for the purpose. Individual-wise data of farmers under trainings and exposure visits needs to be entered in the web based interface above using the ICT infrastructure already available there in the states. Till the time hand-held devices are made available as a part of ITD Interventions, BTMs and ATMs should be encouraged to use their Smart Phones using software to be provided to upload pictures of trainings. Suitable incentive not exceeding Rs.50/- per training may be provided for uploading the pictures of such trainings.  7.5 Impact Assessment Studies of extension work done by Farm Schools, CIGs & FFs under ATMA shall be got conducted by expert agencies and corrective action shall be taken timely to attain objectives of revitalization of Agriculture Extension System. 7.6 Extensive touring of officers of the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation& Farmers Welfare/Directorate of Extension, MANAGE faculty, State/District level officials will be carried out for the on-spot monitoring of field activities being undertaken. 7.7 Concurrent Evaluation : It is concerned with how the program is delivered. It deals with things such as when the program activities occur, where they occur, and who delivers them. Thus, it involves the evaluation of all the activities undertaken to achieve programme objectives. The information generated through this evaluation can be used for improving implementation of the programme by focusing on mid-season/term correction. It is also referred as formative or process evaluation. Yearly concurrent/process evaluation of all activities to be undertaken to achieve programme objectives. The concurrent evaluation is to be taken up every year during the course of implementation of the programme. The purpose is to conduct a broad based SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis so that mid-course correction is initiated at the appropriate point of time. The funds may be utilized for engaging personnel for data collection, compilation, analysis, data processing, evaluation, etc. on task basis.  VIII. BUDGET ALLOCATION, RELEASE & UTILISATION  8. ALLOCATIONS AND SCHEME COST 8.1 CentreState Share : The funding support for the Scheme shall be in the ratio of 60:40 (Centre : State) between Central and State Governments and on 90:10 basis (Centre : State)between central and North-Eastern and Himalayan States for all components including Farmer Friend. 100% GOI funding support to be provided to UTs for all components. 8.2 State-wise Allocation Criteria : Some States have very small districts whereas some other States have very large districts but the size of the Block does not vary much from State to State. Therefore, funds available under the scheme shall be initially allocated to States after giving weightage to the number of Blocks, number of farm families in the State and number of dedicated deployed manpower. Actual release of resources to States shall, however, be on the basis of approved work plans, pace of utilization of funds and physical progress. 8.3 Incentive to States for Better Performance : The States may prepare a large shelf of projects/activities and submit them to the Department at beginning of financial year. Better performing States will be encouraged to seek higher revised allocations against approved activities in respect of Work Plans submitted by them. Such allocations over and above tentative allocation already communicated to States will depend upon relative progress in implementation and pace of expenditure amongst various States and over all availability of funds. However, it is clarified that the expenditure during the year will be restricted by States to funds actually placed at their disposal by the DA&FW and States should not incur expenditure in excess of funds already available with the States. Any proposal to the DA&FW in the following financial year for reimbursement of excess expenditure will not be entertained. Thus, State may not create any liability. 8.4. RELEASE OF FUNDS : 8.4.1 Funds will be released for implementing the Scheme, in four equal installments. State Governments to comply all the instructions of Department of Expenditure O.M dated 23.03.2021 and 23.03.2022. 75% of annual allocation(3 equal installments) will be released upon approved SEWP by SLSC/in-principle approval of SEWP by the Chairman of SLSC and Provisional Utilization Certificate (PUC) & Annual Progress Report (APR) of previous financial year. Additional 25% of allocation(4th installment) will be released upon approved SEWP by SLSC, AUC & APR of the previous year and latest MPR showing at least 75% utilization of earlier release (central + state share). The State will be  required to submit a written request for release of funds. Revised procedure for release of CSS funds to States i.e. SNA-Sparsh will be applicable as per instructions of Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. Release of fourth instalment will depend upon furnishing of the following documents: (i) Approved/ratified SEWP by SLSC. (ii) Audited Utilization Certificate (AUC) & Audited Statement of Expenditure (ASoE) for the previous year. (iii) Monthly Progress Report for previous month (iv) Annual progress report for the previous year (v) Transfer of the stipulated States share to the Single Nodal Account (SNA) against funds provided by Central Government upto the previous year. (vi) Consolidated proposal for release of funds to be submitted to KY Cell through Nodal Officer designated by the State Government. 8.5 Manual reports may be phased out gradually 8.5.1 The State Government will transfer the Central share received in its account to the SNAs account concerned within a period of 21 days of its receipts. The Central share shall not be diverted to the personal deposit account or any other account by the State Government. Corresponding State share should be released as early as possible and not later than 30 days of release of the Central share. 8.5.2 State Governments will follow the revised procedure for release of CSS funds /Just -in- time release using SNA-SPARSH Platform as per the instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance time to time. 8.5.3 The States need to follow a definite time frame for fund releases from State level to District level (within a fortnight of receipt of funds from DA&FW) and from Districts to line departments/other agencies (within 10 days of receipt of money at district level) to ensure expeditious implementation of the Scheme.  IX. OTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS  OTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS 9.1 Extent of Coverage: The Scheme shall be implemented in all districts across the country. 9.2 Incentives for difficult areas : In order to carry out extension activities in difficult areas, an additional 10% allocation may be made by the states in the difficult areas viz: Left Wing Affected Districts, North Eastern & Hilly States, Aspirational Districts and Double Stressed Districts. 9.3 Individual beneficiary oriented activities: i. The Cafeteria of Activities contains some individual beneficiary oriented components as well. Some of such activities include farmers training, demonstrations, farm schools, farmer-scientist interactions & exposure visits which have been culled out from the cafeteria and summarized in Annexure XI. ii. Transparent and objective selection of beneficiaries is of paramount importance not only to generate confidence of the farmers in the Scheme but also to ensure that benefits of extension services get disseminated to all sections of the Society. Therefore, selection of beneficiaries should be done in the following manner: a) All Panchayats in a Block should be covered on a rotation basis under various components. The Panchayats to be covered in a year should be decided by the BTT in consultation with the BFAC. b) Activity mapping of Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) is at ANNEXURE-X. c) Number of beneficiaries of different categories including SC/ST in shortlisted Panchayats will be decided by the BTT in proportion to their population in consultation with BFAC so as to have a balanced coverage. d) At least 50% beneficiaries must be Small and Marginal Farmers and 30% beneficiaries should be women farmers/farm women. e) Individual beneficiaries of demonstration plots, inter-district & inter-state trainings within a Panchayat area and all farmer group beneficiaries should be selected by the respective Gram Sabha or Gram Panchayats in consultation with FIGs and FOs working in the area, as the State Government may decide. However, if for some reasons, the list of beneficiaries is not finalized in the above manner within the stipulated time frame, the FAC in consultation with FIGs and FOs may select the beneficiaries for various activities under the scheme.  If the list of beneficiaries is not finalized in time, the BFAC in consultation with FIGs &FOs may select the beneficiaries f) For rewards and incentives at different levels, beneficiaries may be identified by the States in a transparent manner. It should be ensured that no farmer gets double benefits of the same kind from different schemes. g) ATMAs should capture Unique Identification (UID) details of the farmer beneficiaries under the components of availing training, exposure visits, demonstration plots, farm schools, revolving fund for the CIGs etc. and upload the details in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS) Portal developed by the Department. 9.4 Common Issues related to ATMA Cafeteria: i. Minimum 30% of resources meant for programmes and activities are required to be allocated to women farmers and women extension functionaries. Specific documentation of expenditure and performance for women may be kept. ii. No expenditure shall be incurred from extension work plan allocation on ineligible items. In the event of any such expenditure, the ineligible expenses shall be deducted from the States allocation, next year. iii. Operational Expenses under State Level, District & Block level Activities and Innovative Activities may also include library, internet, telephone and other contingencies. iv. Any sub-detailing not specified under ATMA Cafeteria such as for Demonstrations, Trainings and Exposure Visits, would be as approved under an appropriate scheme of the Central/State Govt. Otherwise, prior approval would have to be obtained from IDWG. v. Unless otherwise specified under some compelling circumstances, or in case of States which are not eligible for PM-RKVY funding, the SLSC set up in the State for considering proposals for PM-RKVY funding will also consider and approve SEWP and carry out periodic monitoring. In exceptional cases, the  existing procedure for approval of SEWP through IDWG at the State level and Executive Committee of SMAE will continue to be followed. The IDWG under the chairmanship of APC/PS (Agriculture) may continue to perform monitoring of the Scheme to ensure that the Extension Reforms are executed as per these Guidelines. The IDWG shall meet at least once in every quarter. vi. Programmatic funds should be spent on rain-fed areas at least in proportion to the extent of rain-fed areas in the district. 9.5 Promotion of Multi-Agency Extension Strategy : (i) In order to ensure promotion of multi-agency extension strategies, and to implement scheme activities in Service Provider mode, at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at district level is to be incurred through Non- Governmental Sector viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. Since a lot of manpower and infrastructure has been given under the Scheme for providing extension services, the State Government should fix an upper limit on extension services in Service Provider mode. This percentage limit should be clearly spelt out in the SEWP. (ii) Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para-Extension Workers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will be eligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities (but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity. Outsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the organisation concerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower deployed under ATMA is unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious tasks. Agri-preneurs under ACABC can also be covered for this 10% service charge and 100% cost of activity after they clear their loan liability though they can be called as experts on honorarium anytime for any training organized otherwise. These organizations are free to voluntarily contribute to the cost of training or fully/partially bear the service charges.

(iii) These would be set up in the field of outstanding or achiever farmers. The list of such farmers having potential for organizing farm schools in the Block for different sectors will be identified jointly by FAC and BTT and sent to ATMA GB through the Panchayat Samiti (block level elected body of Panchayati Raj Institutions). Farm Schools and Farm School Trainers for each season will finally be approved by the ATMA GB. (iv) Teachers in the Farm Schools could be progressive farmers, extension functionaries or experts belonging to Government or Non-Government Sector. (v) One of the main activities of Farm Schools would be to operationalize Front Line Demonstrations in one or more crops and/or allied sector activities. These demonstrations would focus on Integrated Crop Management including field preparation, seed treatment, IPM, INM, etc. (vi) Farm Schools would provide season long technical backstopping/training to target farmers by having an interactive session once at least during each of the 6 critical stages in a cropping season. (vii) While selecting the trainee farmers, about 50% representation should be given to small and marginal farmers. Preference may be given to members of CIGs/FIGs. (viii) Students will visit Farm Schools as per specified schedule or as may be necessary. Teachers may also visit students as may be necessary. (ix) Knowledge and skills of teachers would be upgraded on a continuous basis through training at district/ state/ national level institutions and/or exposure visits, etc. (x) In addition to technical support through Farm Schools, knowledge and skill of students may also be upgraded through training at District/State level and exposure visits, etc. Students would have the responsibility of providing extension support to other farmers in the respective village or neighbouring villages. (xi) Maximum Service Charge to achiever farmer may be 10% of the total cost incurred on item No.1-5 of Farm School cost norm given at (Appendix-II). 93 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA (xii) Achiever Farmer, while conducting the Farm School, can take the technical support from KVK scientists and extension personnel to explain the scientific rationale behind a particular practice. (xiii) Either Training or Exposure Visit of about 5 to 6 days of the Progressive/ Achiever Farmer is supported under the Farm School as per norms approved in the Cafeteria. (xiv) Trainees would bear their own travel expenses. BTM should act as coordinator for Farm Schools with periodic monitoring of the activities done at his level (at least 1 visit at every critical crop stages) to oversee and monitor the functioning & maintain record of visits. He may arrange an Interface between the achiever farmers (taking up Farm School) and the BTT & KVK scientists at least on quarterly basis to exchange ideas at district level. (xv) Performance of all farm schools in each block should be reviewed at BTT-FAC meetings on a half-yearly basis and by ATMA GBs on an annual basis. (xvi) For the reasons to be recorded in writing, highly successful Farm Schools may be continued for another season or two, with provision of only recurring expenses during subsequent years/seasons. When continued in subsequent seasons, the participants should be selected from villages/panchayats not covered in the earlier Farm Schools. (xvii) States may consider suitably awarding the best Farm school in the district/state. (xviii) Trainings in Farm School should be flexible and non-lecture based with emphasis on hands-on-experience, observation, analysis and discussions. (xix) Farm School concept (nature, periodicity & training) needs to be revisited and improved by taking various innovative steps such as involving non- academic experts also from farming and business community and also including Indigenous Technical Knowledge. New training aids like Pico Projectors can be used. 94 ATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA OPERATIONALIZING FARM SCHOOL AT BLOCK / GRAM PANCHAYAT LEVEL COST NORMS/ CEILINGS S.No. Farm School (Block /GP Level) Present Proposed cost - norms of FS (in Rs.) cost - norms of Model- 1 in the field Model- 2- in the FS of Progressive field of Awardee (in Rs.)

Background: Agriculture represent significant and skilled sector in which majority of the cultivation task need higher skills that include land preparation, seed treatment, sowing, fertilizer application, pest management, farm mechanization, irrigation, harvesting, storage, marketing etc. Several cultivation tasks involve intellectual understanding of the package of practices, tools & techniques and process to execute farming practices. As a matter of fact, farmers are performing field operations from production to marketing of farm produce and skilfully undertaken such activities by virtue of their traditional & scientific knowledge and farming experience. It has often been felt that most of the Indian farmers have only access to traditional knowledge and in most cases there is huge gap in existing knowledge and new skill sets required in modernizing agriculture. Besides, farmers need to be empowered with latest farming technologies like irrigation systems, mechanization, high yielding varieties, INM and IPM. However application of technology requires up-gradation of knowledge through training and advisory services. This shall be achieved through short-term bridge courses in the priority areas of agriculture and allied sector, which will act as enabler for up- skilling and empowering the farmers. 2. Vision: To recognize the prior learning and up-skilling of 1.25 crore farmers in next five years for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26. 3. Objective:  To assess the competence of farmers in the structured framework through RPL and up-skilling them to adopt improved farm practices. 4. Implementation Strategy for RPL:  ATMA being the Project Implementing Agency at District level to coordinate with KVKs, SAUs, agriculture & allied Departments, District Training Centres and other local bodies to implementing Guidelines for the same will be issued to States to conduct 2 days RPL based bridge training for capacity building of farmers in agriculture and allied areas.
