Introduction: 1.1 Following successive Budget announcements of 2014-2015 and 2015-16 on setting up an Agri- Tech Infrastructure Fund and the need to create a National Agriculture Market to increase the income of farmers with incidental benefit of moderating price rise respectively, Government approved a Central Sector Scheme for Promotion of National Agriculture Market (NAM) through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF) on 01st July, 2015 with a budget allocation of Rs. 200 crore. The scheme envisages deployment of a common e-market platform in 585 selected regulated wholesale agriculture markets (hereinafter called markets) by March, 2018. The common e-market portal will be called e-NAM. 2. Objectives: The main objectives of the Scheme are - (i) to integrate markets first at the level of the States and eventually across the country through a common online market platform, to facilitate pan - India trade in agricultural commodities; (ii) to streamline marketing / transaction procedures and make them uniform across all markets to promote efficient functioning of the markets; (iii) to promote better marketing opportunities for farmers / sellers through online access to more buyers / markets, removal of information asymmetry between farmer and trader, better and real-time price discovery based on actual demand and supply of agri- commodities, transparency in auction process, prices commensurate with quality of produce, online payment etc. that contribute to marketing efficiency; (iv) to establish quality assaying systems for quality assurance to promote informed bidding by buyers; and (v) to promote stable prices and availability of quality produce to consumers. 3. Scheme design: 3.1 NAM is envisaged as a pan-India electronic trading portal, to be managed centrally by a lead implementing agency i.e. Small Farmers Agribusiness Cconsortium (SFAC), which will network 585 selected markets in a span of three years (2015-16 to 2017-18) to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. NAM is a virtual market but it has a physical market at the back end. While one time registration of farmers / sellers, lot details at the entry gate, weighment, quality assaying, auctions / trade transactions, payment by buyers to sellers and other agencies involved in the chain of transaction will take place online on e-NAM, actual material flow will happen physically through the market. Entire arrivals of agricultural commodities selected for trading on e-NAM will be traded on-line only. Operational Guidelines for Promotion of National Agriculture Market (NAM)  1 3.2 The centralized special software to be developed for e-NAM will be offered free of cost to each market which agrees to join the national network and necessary customization will be undertaken to conform to the provisions of the relevant marketing regulations of each State. 4. Eligibility criteria for availing assistance under the scheme: 4.1 The scheme being linked to agricultural marketing reforms, the States / Union Territories (UTs) need to undertake mandatory reforms in their Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC) Acts in respect of following three areas to avail the assistance under it - (i) single trading license to be valid across the State; (ii) single point levy of market fee across the State; and (iii) provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery to be facilitated by the State Agriculture Marketing Department / Board / APMCs / Regulated Market Committees (RMCs), as the case may be. 4.1.1 In respect of 4.1 (i) above, State/UT must provide, through appropriate legislation / executive order in consonance with the concerned APMC Act / regulation, for issue of single trade license to any eligible person from across India irrespective of ones domicile to enable one to trade through e-NAM portal in the markets across the State / UT. Further, State / UT must provide for a liberal process of single trade license for wholesale traders / buyers for the entire State & ensure that there are no barriers like prohibitively high security deposits or stipulations regarding minimum quantities to be transacted or requirements of establishment of purchase centre / premise etc. 4.1.2 In respect of 4.1 (ii) above, State / UT must provide, through appropriate legislation / executive order in consonance with the concerned APMC Act / regulation for single point levy of market fee for wholesale trading of same produce across the State i.e., levy of market fee / cess at point of first transaction only in the State.

If this support is required to be continued further, concerned market will be required to bear the cost of such person / support. Private markets however will have to bear the cost of mandi analyst from the beginning. (vi) Based on the availability of funds and the number of projects submitted by States / UTs, Department may decide to put a cap on the number of markets that may be covered in this scheme from each of the State/UT. 6.
