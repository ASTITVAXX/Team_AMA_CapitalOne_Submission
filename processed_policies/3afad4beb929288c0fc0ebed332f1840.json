It is only through the development of infrastructure, especially at the post-harvest stage that the produce can be optimally utilized with opportunity for value addition and fair deal for the farmers. Development of such infrastructure shall also address the vagaries of nature, the regional disparities, development of human resource and realization of full potential of our limited land resource. In view of above, the Honble Finance Minister announced on 15.05.2020, 1 lakh crore Agri Infrastructure Fund for farm-gate infrastructure for farmers. Financing facility of  1,00,000 crore will be provided for funding Agriculture Infrastructure Projects at farm-gate & aggregation points Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies, Farmers Producer Organizations, Agriculture entrepreneurs, Start-ups, etc. Impetus for development of farm- gate & aggregation point, affordable and financially viable Post Harvest Management infrastructure. Accordingly, DA&FW has formulated the Central Sector Scheme to mobilize a medium - long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects relating to post-harvest management Infrastructure and community farming assets through incentives and financial support. Subsequently, in the budget announcement made on 01.02.2021, it was decided to extend the benefit of the scheme to APMCs. Accordingly, modifications in the scheme were carried out with the approval of Cabinet to make it more inclusive. 2 Rationale of the Scheme Agriculture and allied activities are the primary income source for 58% of total population of India. 85% of the farmers are Small Holding Farmers (SHFs) with less than 2 hectares of land under cultivation and manage 45% of agricultural land. Annual income of 3 majority of the farmers is very low. Further, India has limited infrastructure connecting farmers to markets and hence, 15-20% of yield is wasted which is relatively high in comparison to other countries where it ranges between 5-15%. Investment in agriculture in India has further been stagnant with less than 2% CAGR over last 5 years. Investment in FY17 was   2.19 lakh crore out of which private sector share was 83% vs. a higher investment of   2.50 lakh crore in FY14 and a higher share of private sector at 88%. Also, lack of investor confidence is leading to lower plowback ratio (14% of Gross Value addition in FY18) vs. other sectors (33% of Gross Value addition in FY18). 3 Objectives of the Scheme To mobilize a medium - long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management Infrastructure and community farming assets through incentives and financial support in order to improve agriculture infrastructure in the country. This financing facility will fulfil numerous objectives for all the stakeholders in the agriculture eco-system. a. Farmers (including FPOs, PACS, Marketing Cooperative Societies, Multipurpose cooperative societies, State Agencies, Agricultural Produce Market Committees (Mandis), National & State Federations of Cooperatives, Federations of FPOs and Federations of Self Help Groups (SHGs) etc.). - Improved marketing infrastructure to allow farmers to sell directly to a larger base of consumers and hence, increase value realization for the farmers. This will improve the overall income of farmers. - With investments in logistics infrastructure, farmers will be able to sell in the market with reduced post-harvest losses and a smaller number of intermediaries. This further will make farmers independent through improved access to market. - With modern packaging and cold storage system access, farmers will be able to further decide when to sell in the market and improve realization. - Community farming assets for improved productivity and optimization of inputs will result in substantial savings to farmers. b. Government - Government will be able to direct priority sector lending in the currently unviable projects by supporting through interest subvention, incentive through 4 convergence and credit guarantee. This will initiate the cycle of innovation and private sector investment in agriculture. - Due to improvements in post-harvest infrastructure, government will further be able to reduce national food wastage percentage thereby enable agriculture sector to become competitive with current global levels. - Central/State Government Agencies or local bodies will be able to structure viable projects on their own or PPP projects for attracting investment in agriculture infrastructure. c. Agri-entrepreneurs and startups - With a dedicated source of funding, entrepreneurs will push for innovation in agriculture sector by leveraging new age technologies including IoT, AI, etc. - It will also connect the players in ecosystem and hence, improve avenues for collaboration between entrepreneurs and farmers. d. Banking ecosystem - With Credit Guarantee, convergence and interest subvention lending institutions will be able to lend with a lower risk. This scheme will help to enlarge their customer base and diversification of portfolio. - Refinance facility will enable larger role for cooperative banks and RRBs. e. Consumers - With reduced inefficiencies in post-harvest ecosystem, key benefit for consumers will be a larger share of produce reaching the market and hence, better quality and prices. Overall, the investment via the financing facility in agriculture infrastructure will benefit all the stakeholders in the eco-system. 4 Implementation Period of Scheme The Scheme will be operational from 2020-21 to 2032-33. Loan disbursement under the scheme will complete in six years, i.e. by the end of Financial Year 2025-26.
